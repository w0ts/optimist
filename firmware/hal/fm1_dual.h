/* FM-1 second core (CPU1) bring-up and the shared mailbox (docs/DUAL-CORE.md).
 *
 * Start sequence: the one the stock M-VAVE application uses (its code at XIP
 * 0x02059a2e, disassembled with the vendor objdump):
 *   [0x01C7FFF8] = CPU1 entry      (the SPL RAM handoff vector; = vector slot 126, SOFT6)
 *   [0x10008]   |= 8               (kept until CPU1 answered, then restored; meaning unknown)
 *   C1_CON      |= 8, &= ~2        (run, out of reset)
 *   wait for CPU1 to write an acknowledgement
 * Stop (AC79 SDK cpu/wl82/debug.c, halting the other core): C1_CON &= ~8, |= 2.
 *
 * The entry (fm1_dual.S) sets CPU1's stacks and returns (rti) into C code, as
 * the stock entry does. CPU1 runs with its interrupts off, except one: with FELUCCA_DUAL_IDLE it sleeps
 * (idle) between jobs and CPU0 wakes it with soft interrupt 124 (SOFT4, the SDK's CPU1 IPI), whose
 * handler runs the job (fm1_dual_wake_*, below; dual.c).
 *
 * Flash rule: while CPU0 programs or erases the flash (XIP off), CPU1 must not
 * fetch from XIP. CPU1 runs XIP code only between a job's request and its done
 * flag, and both happen inside CPU0's audio interrupt; the rest of the time it
 * spins in fm1_dual_idle_ram (below, .ram_text, no calls, no constants). */
