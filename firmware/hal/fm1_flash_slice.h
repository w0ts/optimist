/* A 4 KiB sector erase in short interrupts-off windows: the erase is suspended (75h) after FLS_SLICE_US, the
 * interrupts run with the XIP back on, and the erase is resumed (7Ah) in the next window. Without it the whole erase
 * (P25Q80H tSE 8 ms typical, 12 ms max; 17.2 ms measured as SYSTEM > INTERNALS' FLASH IRQS OFF on a dual-core Synth
 * build, 2026-10-16) is one window, three audio halves.
 *
 * P25Q80H datasheet (Puya, §5.4 and §10.36 - 10.38): the suspend latency tESL is 30 us max; the memory reads while an
 * erase is suspended, except the sector being erased; WIP is 0 and SUS1 is 1 while suspended (the datasheet names bit
 * 10 SUS1 in §10.36 and bit 15 in its register table: either is taken); "in order for an Erase operation to make
 * progress, tERS >= 200us must be included in resume-to-suspend loop(s)"; the resume sets WIP to 1 at once.
 *
 * Safe on a part that ignores the suspend: when WIP is still 1 FLS_SUS_US after it, the window silences the audio
 * buffer and waits the erase out (as before this file: one window), and says so (FLS_HELD). After FLS_SLICES_MAX
 * windows the last one does the same (an erase that does not progress is never left suspended).
 *
 * Pure logic on the primitives below, so the host test (tests/flash_slice_test.c) runs it on a model of the part:
 *   FLS_NOW()          ticks, 24 per us, wrapping (TIMER4)
 *   FLS_SR1()          status register 1 (05h): bit 0 WIP, bit 1 WEL
 *   FLS_SR2()          status register 2 (35h): bits 2 / 7 SUS1 / SUS2 (S10 / S15)
 *   FLS_ERASE(off)     20h + address
 *   FLS_CMD(c)         a one-byte command (06h WREN, 75h suspend, 7Ah resume)
 *   FLS_INVAL(off)     drop the sector's cache lines
 * Everything here runs with the XIP off (inlined into a .ram_text function in fm1_flash.h): no libcalls, no
 * .rodata, no division by a variable.
 *
 * The XIP side, fls_erase(): the windows in a loop, the interrupts on between them (FLS_WINDOW_FN / FLS_GAP, the
 * caller's: in fm1_flash.h each window is a whole irq_save / irq_restore, so the dual-core park handshake runs for each
 * one, as for each page program). */
