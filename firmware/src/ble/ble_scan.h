 * advertising report parsed (Core Specification Supplement Part A: flags, the 128-bit service UUID lists, the
 * shortened and complete local name), and the table of the devices found nearby, which the DEVICES list shows.
 *
 * Plain data, no radio: the link layer hands the raw reports over (ble_ll_scan_take, from the RX interrupt through a
 * ring) and the main loop feeds them here. Only advertisers that are connectable (ADV_IND) and carry the BLE-MIDI
 * service UUID (in the advertisement or in the scan response) are listed; an advertiser seen without it is kept
 * "unconfirmed" until its scan response says, and is the first to go when the table is full. */
