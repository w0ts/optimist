/* The baseband driver's interface: what the link layer (ble_ll.c) asks of the radio, and what the driver
 * reports back. Designed for a link-controller engine that does the timing of each event in hardware:
 *   advertising on 37 / 38 / 39 with an automatic SCAN_RSP; anchors, the transmit window, CSA #1 hopping, the
 *   access-address match, CRC (software gives the CRC init), SN / NESN with acknowledgement and retransmission
 *   from two alternating TX buffers (and two RX buffers), the connection event counter and the instant compare.
 * The link layer keeps the queues, the control procedures, the supervision timeout and the encryption.
 *
 * Context: every ble_ll_hw_* call comes from one context, the driver's BLE interrupts (the event IRQ and the
 * RX IRQ at one priority, never nested in each other); every ble_hw_* call is made from inside one of them,
 * except ble_hw_adv_start() at start-up (ble_enable() with the BLE IRQs not yet on, or masked).
 *
 * PDUs are passed as they are on air without access address and CRC: the 2-octet header (octet 0: type / LLID
 * and flags, octet 1: length) followed by the payload. Multi-octet fields inside are least significant first.
 *
 * How this maps onto the AC791N engine (docs/BLE-HW-FACTS.md, sections in brackets; the driver's job):
 *   - one link (n = 0): its 324-byte control block and the TX / RX payload buffers in the baseband RAM block
 *     (3, 4); columns through the port at 0x2801C / 0x28020 (2.3); IRQ 45 = event, IRQ 29 = RX (8, 10);
 *   - ble_hw_adv_start: ADV_IND into TX buffer 0, SCAN_RSP into TX buffer 1 (the engine answers SCAN_REQ by
 *     itself), interval in 625 us slots in columns 1 / 15, state 2 (6). Our header octet 0 is the Core layout
 *     (TxAdd bit 6); TXAHDR wants TxAdd in bit 4: the driver moves it;
 *   - ble_ll_hw_connect_ind is called from the RX IRQ that holds the CONNECT_IND, and ble_hw_conn_start is
 *     called inside it: the same link goes from state 2 to 7 before the IRQ returns, with the window widening
 *     from interval and SCA, and the first anchor 1.25 ms + WinOffset after the CONNECT_IND (7). The link
 *     layer does nothing slow on that path (the host only resets its state);
 *   - ble_ll_hw_tx fills the free fixed TX buffer: TXDHDR = length << 8 | MD << 3 | LLID, keeping the engine's
 *     bit 2; our MD is header bit 4 (Core layout); INTFRAME bit 6 = MD; TXBUFnCNTL bit 0 cleared last (8.2). At the
 *     end of each connection RX IRQ, a buffer we loaded whose bit 0 reads 1 again (empty) is ble_ll_hw_tx_acked,
 *     then ble_ll_hw_tx for the next (8.2);
 *   - ble_ll_hw_rx: the header rebuilt from RXDHDRn (Core layout already), the payload from the RX buffer; packets
 *     with RXSTAT [3:0] != 1 are not passed on (8);
 *   - ble_ll_hw_event_end from IRQ 45 with column 3 - 1 as the counter (8);
 *   - ble_hw_conn_update / ble_hw_chmap_update: column 5 = instant at once; the new window, widening, interval
 *     (columns 1, 2, 4, 15) or the channel tables are written in the event IRQ of event instant - 1 (9);
 *   - the supervision timeout is software (7): the link layer's, from ble_hw_time_us;
 *   - ble_hw_addr: the stored BLE address (VM id 104, public in stock: TxAdd 0) (11). */
