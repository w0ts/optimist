/* The radio's stored calibration (route C, docs/BLE-STACK.md §12): a read-only reader of stock V15's SDK "VM" store
 * and the copy Optimist keeps of the four RF records. Written from docs/BLE-HW-FACTS.md §14 / §15.4 (branch
 * feat/ble-facts, d907ce3), not from vendor code. Portable C, no C library; host-tested in tests/ble_vm_test.c.
 *
 *   VM      where: a short list of candidate areas, the first that starts 55 AA AA 55 AND whose first record (length
 *           > 0, inside the area) passes its check is the live one (the magic alone is not enough: Optimist keeps
 *           UP_FM6's voices at 0x093000 on an FM-1, which must never read as a VM):
 *             0x0E8000, 4 KiB: measured on an FM-1 (2026-10-08, console 'flr' after stock V15 booted, then Optimist
 *                      installed by stock's updater): the magic and the six records 106 107 187 108 113 109; the
 *                      next sector, 0x0E9000, is BTIF (record 102), so this area cannot be longer than 4 KiB;
 *             0x0E7000, 4 KiB: NOT measured, only a candidate for the second area (read FF on that unit);
 *             0x093000 / 0x095000, 8 KiB each: the emulator's layout (§14.1; read FF on the FM-1), kept so the
 *                      emulator's runs still find their VM (both marked: 0x093000).
 *           Where stock's second area is on hardware, and its size there, are not known.
 *           Records packed from area + 4: [check = low byte of CRC-16/XMODEM of the data] [id 7:0]
 *           [id 11:8 | len 3:0 << 4] [len 11:4], then the data. The log ends at the first failing check (an erased
 *           header always fails) or a record past the area; the last valid record of an id wins (§14.2, §14.3).
 *   RF      106 (2 B, crystal trims), 107 (7 B, PA), 108 (20 B, PA digital gain), 187 (68 B: 64 + its own
 *           CRC-16/XMODEM little-endian + 00 00) (§14.5). A set is complete when all four are there with these
 *           lengths and 187's inner CRC holds.
 *   copy    100 bytes kept with the settings (storage/project.c persist_t): mark, source area, the four records'
 *           data (97 B), CRC-16/XMODEM of the first 98 bytes, little-endian (§15.4 step 2).
 *   choice  the VM's set, else the copy, else none: with none the radio is never started (§15.4 step 3).
 *
 * Nothing here writes flash. */
