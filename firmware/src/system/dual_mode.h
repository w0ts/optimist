 *        setting then turns itself OFF (saved), so the next boots stay on one core until it is set back to AUTO.
 *   OFF (1): one core.
 * A boot that follows one that crashed in its first 30 s (bootguard.failed) stays on one core too, whatever the setting.
 * The FM-1's own supply start-up is a builder item (FELUCCA_STOCK_SUPPLY, hal/fm1_supply.h), not a value here; when its
 * read-back is wrong CPU1 is not started (SUPPLY, dual_supply_why). */
