/* The second core (CPU1): docs/DUAL-CORE.md.
 *
 * FELUCCA_DUAL 1  stage 1: CPU1 starts and counts in RAM (shown on the screen); no audio work.
 * FELUCCA_DUAL 2  CPU1 renders some of the block's jobs (a synth part: mix_part, its engine, DIST, SLICER,
 *                 level, pan, sends into its own accumulators; the drum track: slicer_drums and dbus_run into
 *                 the buses) while CPU0 renders the others, inside the same audio block (fork / join in the
 *                 ALNK0 interrupt). The sums are integer: the same samples whichever core renders what.
 *                 Which jobs go to CPU1 is decided each block (dual_split): each job's render time, measured
 *                 on the core that ran it (TIMER4 ticks, smoothed), and the longest first onto the core with
 *                 less so far (perf/mots-hot, 2026-10-13: the X0X 808 alone was half of CPU0's work, while
 *                 parts 2-3 on CPU1 left it at 10 %). A build with DUAL_PARTS set (the emulator's
 *                 references, tests/emu_dual_check.py) keeps that fixed set of parts on CPU1 and the drums on
 *                 CPU0, as before.
 *
 * FELUCCA_DUAL_IDLE 1 (with 2, the default): CPU1 sleeps (idle) between jobs; CPU0 posts a job and raises
 *                 soft interrupt 124, whose handler on CPU1 runs it (fm1_cpu1_wake); 0: CPU1 spins in RAM.
 *
 * Never a hang: CPU1 that does not answer at boot stays in reset; a job that is not done within
 * DUAL_JOIN_US, or a fault on CPU1, puts CPU1 back into reset for good and CPU0 renders everything
 * (the parts CPU1 was rendering may click once).
 *
 * FM-1s whose CPU1 misreads RAM (docs/DUAL-CORE.md section 4): CPU1 runs only the next posted job with a matching check
 * word (hal/fm1_dual_guard.h, after X0X), reads a boot canary before its hello, and is held at the first request it
 * refuses (MISREAD) or a wrong canary (CANARY). 2ND CORE OFF (dual_mode.h) or a boot after an early crash: one core.
 * FELUCCA_STOCK_SUPPLY: the FM-1's own supply start-up at the top of the boot (supply_boot, hal/fm1_supply.h). */
