/* The drum lanes' LFO record (storage/dlfo_rec.c) in flash, included by sections.c (the section log, FELUCCA_SECTIONS 8 /
 * 16), as the FX record (fx/fx_rec_log.c): a section's LFO record is a log record of its own, id DLR_ID0 + section
 * (122..137), the autosave's DLR_ID_AUTO (138), beside the section's record and never inside it. An older build skips
 * these ids (past its SLG_IDS: not indexed) and its compaction drops them: its sections load there with every LFO off.
 *   record  key (4 bytes: the FNV-1a hash of the section's record as stored; the autosave: its project's sum), then the
 *           stored form (drums/lane_play.c dlfo_encode). Nothing to keep: no record (a tombstone clears an older one).
 * The key pairs the two: a section saved again without its LFO record finds an old key and plays every LFO off, never
 * another version's. A section stored while playing keeps its LFO record in the pending arena beside it (SEC_PEND_DL +
 * section), written with it. Snapshots (snapshots.c SNR_DLFO) and the editor's backup (ed_backup.c DLFO) carry these
 * records too. */
