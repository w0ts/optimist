 * function the panel calls (undo_apply, main loop only: it takes the audio interrupt off itself, or is told it is inside it by undo_isr; the editor's
 * requests run in ed_service, never in an interrupt). The editor's own step writes are levels of that history too (ed_undo_edit marks the track first).
 *   102 UNDO  op -> op, rc, done lo, done hi, all lo, all hi, track, can_undo, can_redo
 *       op 0 the state, 1 undo, 2 redo; rc 0 done, 1 nothing to undo / redo (nothing moved); done / all: the levels applied / held, 2 x 7 bits;
 *       track: the last undo or redo's track (0..3). A bad op: no reply. INFO tag 0x5F: version 1, flags (bit 0: a history of many levels). */
