/* Editor protocol v13: the SCOPE (ui/optimist/op_scope.c; included by editor.c; web/EDITOR_PROTOCOL.md "v13: the scope"; builds with the Optimist UI only).
 * The device's oscilloscope: one ring of the audio (fx.c vis_pcm) of one source at a time, drawn trigger-stable (the latest rising zero crossing after a swing
 * below) and scaled to its peak. This hands out the same trace: the editor asks for a source and gets the points the device would draw.
 *   101 SCOPE  src -> src, shift, peak v14, n (2 x 7 bits), n heights (0..127, 64 the zero line, up is above)
 *       src   0 MASTER, 1..4 the tracks T1 T2 T3 DR (a drum lane is DR); a bad src: no reply
 * Asking sets the ring's source as the panel's SCOPE would (op_scope.c scope_tick) for the next 2 s: ask again about every 50 ms to watch; while asked, the mixer's MASTER
 * meter on the device reads that source too. shift is the right shift that fits the peak in the heights (never amplified: a quiet source is a small trace); peak is the
 * ring's largest sample (>> 2, at most 8191). INFO tag 0x5E: version 1, n. */
