/* MIDI clock out (FELUCCA_MIDI_CLKOUT; the HOME menu's CLOCK OUT, OFF / ON, a setting of the FM-1: settings word bit
 * 26). Included by seq.c after clock_sync.c (sync_out_t, sy, sy_div); events_block calls clko_block once a
 * block of CTL samples, after the steps, before the transport clock moves on.
 *
 * What is sent: F8 at 24 a beat, always while ON (also stopped, so the other side can lock to the tempo first, as most
 * hardware sequencers do); FA at a start from the top, then the downbeat's F8; F2 (song position, 16ths) + FB at a
 * start from elsewhere (following an external clock's CONTINUE); FC at a stop. On USB (the TRS jack is MIDI IN only:
 * no TX on the FM-1's board), and to a BLE central that listens (io/midi/midi_ble.c ble_rt_q, each sent
 * at the first connection event after it is due, with its time as its BLE-MIDI timestamp).
 *
 * Time. The ticks are those of the transport clock (core.h: clk_beat, clk_pos; BEAT_U / 24 units a tick), so they
 * follow tempo changes, the TEMPO page's nudge and the arranger, and never swing (swing moves only the odd steps of a
 * grid, seq.c grid_at). Each F8 is due when the audio of its position leaves the I2S DMA: the block's time (audio.c
 * sync_out_t, + SYNC_DAC_T, + SYNC_LIM_T while the master limiter is on: its 1.45 ms) + its offset in the block; usb.c sends it within 0.05 ms of that. On the internal tempo
 * a step starts at the first block whose start is at or past it, CTL / 2 late on average (0 .. 0.73 ms): the F8s get
 * that mean too, so a step and its F8 leave within +-0.36 ms, the F8s with no jitter of their own. Following an
 * external clock the steps start at their sample (ev_map): the F8s at the same sample, no CTL / 2.
 *
 * Following an external clock (clock_sync.c, sy.src): the F8s go on at the followed tempo, timed as the steps are
 * (a re-timed, de-jittered copy), never back out of the port being followed (no loop through a host that echoes):
 * following USB, nothing goes to USB, BLE gets it; following BLE, nothing goes to BLE; following TRS, both get it. */
