/* USB audio capture routing (FELUCCA_USB_AUDIO): where each source of the mix goes among the four capture channels
 * (SYSTEM > USB AUDIO, one line a source; the user, 2026-10-17: "each track, including master, can be assigned to none, 1,
 * 2, 1+2, 3, 4, 3+4", and the drum lanes), and the taps in the mix that only a source's choice turns on. Included by core.h
 * (the drums and fx.c write the taps); usb_audio_route.c builds the channels from them (audio.c ua_block).
 *
 * The sources, and where each is taken:
 *   MASTER       the master output as the FM-1's own output gets it, in stereo: after the master inserts, the volume, the
 *                limiter (or LIMIT's brickwall) and the knee, before the codec's -6 dB shift (Q15 full scale = 0 dBFS here).
 *   T1 T2 T3     a synth track's stem: after its inserts, its LEVEL and its mute, before its pan, its sends, the FX buses
 *                and the master (POST-fader: what the track contributes to the mix, without the space). Mono.
 *   DRUMS        the drum track's stem: its lanes summed (mono), each after its lane level, cut and inserts and the drum
 *                track's level and mute, before the lanes' and the track's pan and the drum bus inserts.
 *   DRUM BUS     the drum bus in stereo: after its pans and its two insert slots (dbus_run), before its sends and the master.
 *   DR1..DR10    one drum lane's own share of DRUMS (the same point: post lane level / cut / inserts and the track's level
 *                and mute, pre pan). Only the lanes routed are tapped, only while the host records: a voice of another
 *                lane costs one mask test a block (drums.c, drum_x0x.c, fx.c dins_post). The declick tail of a stopped
 *                voice (drums.tail) belongs to no lane: it is in DRUMS only.
 *   RET A B C    an FX return in stereo, as the mixer's MASTER page lists them (fx_slots.c fxs_card: return k's send line,
 *                whatever it holds: the chorus, the delay, the reverb, or another type): its wet after the return's own
 *                processing, its return level and MUTE, as it enters the master (before PUNCH, the master inserts and the
 *                volume): what the return adds to the mix. A return with nothing in it (or none on its line) records
 *                silence. Named by the slot, not by its type: the choice belongs to the return, whatever type it holds
 *                later (the mixer's "A SENDS" .. "C SENDS"). Only the returns routed are tapped, only while the host records
 *                (ua_ret_block): none routed, a test a line a block (fx.c fx_buses, rt_line).
 * The destinations: NONE, 1, 2, 1+2, 3, 4, 3+4. A stereo source (MASTER, DRUM BUS, RET A B C) on a pair goes left to the first channel,
 * right to the second; on one channel, its two sides to mono, (L + R) / 2 (each side x 0.5, -6.02 dB: never clips; a
 * floor). A mono source on a pair is on both. Sources on one channel add up (the capture clips at its conversion,
 * usb_audio_stream.c ua_clip). PRE-fader stems are not offered: a stem is the track's contribution at its mixer level (a
 * muted track records silence). Defaults = the routing before this setting: T1 on 1, T2 on 2, T3 on 3, DRUMS on 4. */
