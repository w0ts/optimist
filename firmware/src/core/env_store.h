/* ENV 1 MOD's depths and ENV2 DEST's two slots (core.h P_E1PIT .., P_N2DA ..) and the forms they had. Header only
 * (params.c, upreset.c's host test), after lfo_store.h (lfo_cl) and env1_cards.h (the engines' cards).
 *
 * ENV 1: before 2026-10-14 it was wired to the amplitude and had a depth on FLT and SHP (P_ED_FLT P_ED_SHP, -64..63;
 * ENV DEST PIT is the pitch drop, not ENV: it stays, DROP). From 2026-10-14 to 16 it had two free slots (ENV DEST, the
 * ids P_E1PIT .. P_E1Z were its DEST A AMT A DEST B AMT B: a project's modulation record MREC_TAG 0xD2, user presets
 * UP_VER 3) with the depths' words at 0. Since 2026-10-16 it is the engine's own envelope again (env1_cards.h): the
 * amplitude always, FLT SHP in their words, PIT and the moves in P_E1PIT .. P_E1Z. A file of before 2026-10-14 is read
 * as it is; one of the slots folds them (env1_fold).
 * ENV2 (ANALOG's) had five depths: FLT (P_A2FENV) PIT SHP OSC2 SDTN (P_A2EPIT ..). A project, a preset, a user preset of
 * before comes in as slots that sound the same (env_load): the two heaviest (|depth|, a tie: the first) in their order.
 * A depth left out is counted (lost). The slots are stored as values of their own (project.c's modulation record,
 * upreset.c); those words are 0 at run time and in what is saved. env_store writes the slots back as the depths they
 * are, as far as they go (a SLOOP bank's record, the tests) */
