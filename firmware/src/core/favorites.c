/* Favorites (FELUCCA_FAVORITES): marked sounds, after Felucca 1.6's favorites (hugelton/Felucca, GPL-3.0-only, favorites.c).
 * Included by core/model.c (the list) and storage/persist_rec.c (the settings record); the host tests include either.
 *
 * Felucca keeps a bit per preset of 16 engines (512 B) in its settings. Here a factory sound is marked by a 16-bit mark
 * of its engine's UID and its name (a sound's place in this build's list moves with the engines and kits a build leaves
 * out; its UID and name do not), up to FAV_N of them, packed from 0; a user preset by its slot, one bit of 32. 136 B in
 * all, the last field of the settings record (persist_rec.c). A mark of a sound this build leaves out stays as saved
 * (it is no place in the list; it comes back with the engine). The engines' own collections (nbank.c: FM6 F01.., CZ
 * Z01..) are not marked: their sounds are slots whose contents the player edits.
 * A mark is nonzero; 0 is an empty place. Two sounds sharing a mark (1 in 65536 a pair) would both read as marked. */
