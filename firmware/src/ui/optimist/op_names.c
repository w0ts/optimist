/* The names table (the Optimist UI's style guide, sections 1-4; the 2026-10-14 coherence audit, batch A): one spelling
 * for each thing the screens name, in three forms, from the names the shared tables give (params.c PAGES' titles, the
 * descriptors' labels, the engines', the drums', this UI's own cells). Looked up when drawn: what the cells, the rows
 * and the help line key on (op_help.c: the label, the row's name) stays the shared name, so SLOOP's UI, the web editor
 * and tools/param_help.json are untouched.
 *   title   a row's name in the list and the page's title in the header, sentence case, 9 characters at most and short
 *           enough to fit whole with its n/N next to the widest badge of its screen ("2 DIGITAL", "4 ACCENT"):
 *           "ENV to", "Scale", "Inserts" (tests/ui_optimist_names.h walks every one)
 *   card    a card's label, in capitals, 6 characters at most (an action's object 8): "LEVEL", "DETUNE", "DEST A"
 *   cell    a list cell, 4 characters: the engines' and the verbs' fixed forms ("ANLG", "CLR", "INS"), never a cut
 * A name with no entry is shown as given: a card label as it is (in capitals already), a title in sentence case
 * (op_case: "VOICE 2" -> "Voice 2"; ENV, LFO, ARP kept). Names the user or a pack owns (presets, kits, lanes, projects)
 * never pass through here: they are drawn as stored.
 * The tables: "key\0form\0" pairs, an empty key ends them. A '#' in a key matches one digit, which the form's '#'
 * repeats ("OP# LEVEL" -> "OP# out"); "CTX:" before a card key limits it to the engine CTX ("DIGITAL:R#": DIGITAL's
 * ratios, not FM6's rates). Flash only: const strings, searched in the main loop when a band is drawn. */
