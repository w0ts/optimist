# ENV 1 as the engine's own envelope: design (audit + plan, no firmware changed)

Branch `design/env-mod` from LOCAL optimist 9be3754a. Status: design only. The user ruled on 2026-10-16 that ENV 1 is
**not parametric**: it has no DEST/AMT pickers. ENV 1 is the engine's own envelope. Its destinations are fixed and
made in advance, one plain depth knob each, chosen per engine. ENV 2, LFO 1 and LFO 2 keep their free DEST A/B + AMT A/B.

Evidence: batch 141 = `062e3f19` "ENV DEST and ENV2 DEST: two free slots each" (plus `6a810504`, which stores the slots
in the modulation record and as UP_VER 3, and `f4bf244d`, which has JUNO read `ENV1_FLT_AMT`). Before that commit
(`062e3f19~1`, voice.c 1080-1121), ENV worked like this: the amplitude was **hard-wired** (`m.envq15 = env`), plus
`m.cutoff += envq15*P_ED_FLT>>7` and `m.shape += envq15*P_ED_SHP>>7`. ENV DEST PIT (`P_ED_PIT`) was **not ENV**: it is a
fixed ~40 ms pitch drop (`v->penv`), now called DROP. ANALOG's ENV2 had five fixed depths (FLT PIT SHP OSC2 SDTN).

## 1. Per engine

"Reads" lists which outputs of the voice.c mod path the engine actually uses (grep of `m->cutoff`, `m->shape`,
`envq15`, `amp_at`/`amp1`, pitch). A dead path means an ENV slot on it does nothing today.

| Engine | Envelopes it has (besides ENV 2, which runs on every engine) | Reads | ENV 1 slots today (default A=AMP 127, B=FLT or SHP from the preset) | Before 141 | **Proposed ENV 1 page: 4 fixed depth knobs** (amp always wired, see §1a) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ANALOG (and SUPER, its swarm alias) | track ADSR | cut, shape=PW, pitch, amp | all work | amp, FLT, SHP | **FLT, PIT, SHP(PW), RES** |
| DIGITAL | ADSR + MDEC (the modulator index EG, internal) | cut+shape both drive the FM index | FLT = SHP = index | amp, FLT, SHP (same effect) | **IDX** (the FLT path), **PIT**, **FB** (E6), **MDEC** (E5) |

| NOISE | ADSR | cut=FREQ, shape=COLR | all | amp, FLT, SHP | **FREQ** (FLT path), **PIT**, **COLR** (SHP path), **RES** (E3) |

### 1a. The card kinds and the amplitude

* **Amplitude: always wired, as it was before 141.** `amp = env` (after `e->amp`, the engine's own curve). No AMP
  knob. Engines whose own envelope ends the voice (CZ, FM6, ACID, LOFI STEP) keep ending it as they do today.
* Each of the 4 cards is one of three kinds, held in a flash table per engine (`env1[4] = {label, kind, arg}`, about
  16 engines x 4 x 3 B = ~200 B of flash):
  1. **Path depth.** FLT, SHP or PIT on the voice paths, with the arithmetic from before 141 (`envq15*d>>7`; PIT is
     new and works like today's LT_PIT, +-31.5 st at full).
  2. **Value depth (E-move).** ENV moves one EDIT value for each voice, using today's `env_vmove` (XIP flash, as LC_VAL
     works now).
  3. **Alias.** The card is the engine's own EDIT value that already controls its envelope (ACID, CZ, FM6, PHASE DCW).
     This needs no new storage and no DSP change: it is the same parameter shown a second time on the ENV 1 page.

## 2. ENV 2, LFO 1, LFO 2: kept as built

Their pages, ids (P_N2DA..P_N2AB, P_L1DA.., P_L2DA..), the shared LT_* list and storage stay exactly as built. Three
small changes:

* `LT_N1AMT` ("E1 AMT") keeps its number. It now scales ENV 1's depth knobs (not AMP).
* `LT_ATK`..`LT_REL` stay (ENV 1's times as destinations).
* `LT_AMP` on ENV 2 or an LFO multiplies on top of the wired ENV 1 amplitude, as it does today.

## 3. Migration (formats may change; Optimist's own old files must load sensibly)

**Ids.** `P_ED_FLT` and `P_ED_SHP` become live again as ENV 1's FLT and SHP depths (-64..63). Every format already
stores these words: project track words, UP_VER 3 words, SLOOP export, the editor. Since 141 they are written as 0. The
four ENV DEST ids are repurposed so that no id moves and P_COUNT stays the same: `P_N1DA` becomes `P_E1PIT` (ENV 1 PIT
depth), `P_N1AA` becomes `P_E1X` (card 4: the E-move depth), and `P_N1DB`/`P_N1AB` are reserved (hidden, def 0). An
alias card has no id of its own.

| Source | How it loads |
|---|---|
| Project from before 141 (no modulation record, or tag-less) | The words already hold FLT/SHP depths: **as is**, same sound. DROP is unchanged. |
| Project 141..now (modulation record `MREC_TAG 0xD2`, parts' ENV DEST bytes) | Fold the slots: AMP (any AMT) is dropped because amp is wired. FLT a goes to `P_ED_FLT += a/2`, SHP a to `P_ED_SHP += a/2`, PIT a to `P_E1PIT = a`. Anything else (RES, E1..E8, ATK..REL, PAN/LVL/sends/INS, L1/L2, E2 AMT, OSC2, SDTN): **moved to ENV 2** if ENV 2's slots are all OFF (copy ATK DEC SUS REL into ATK2..REL2, then put the slot in ENV 2 A/B). Otherwise it is **dropped and counted** in the TOOLS > MISS style "lost" note. |
| New saves | `MREC_TAG 0xD3`. The parts' block keeps 20 bytes; ENV 1's 4 bytes become E1PIT, E1X, 0, 0. FLT/SHP go back in their words. |
| User presets UPB3 / UP_VER 3 | Read with the same fold. Written as **UP_VER 4**: the same 216-byte record, with slot bytes 0..3 reinterpreted. UPB2/UPB1 read as today (depth words, so as is). |
| Factory presets (`preset_t.fenv`, XP `P_ED_SHP`) | Straight into the depths. `env_load` is no longer needed for ENV 1. |
| Sections (SEC records), motion and locks on P_N1DA..P_N1AB | Convert like params.c's "event on a depth of before": AMT on a FLT slot becomes a P_ED_FLT event (/2), and so on. Events on DEST ids, or on dropped targets, are dropped. |
| SLOOP bank export (sl24_export) | Simpler: FLT/SHP words direct. `env_store`'s ENV 1 half is deleted. |
| Web editor files (`DST A#1`.. label keys, editor.html 3344-3387) | Map ENV DEST's DST A/B and AMT A/B into FLT/SHP/PIT using the same fold. ENV2's `DST A#2` is unchanged. |

**Lost on load:** only post-141 projects that put ENV 1 on a non-path destination while ENV 2 was already in use, plus
odd AMTs (one LSB). ENV 1 AMP below 127 or negative also cannot be kept, because amp is wired: the sound changes.

## 4. UI impact

* PAGES (params.c 687) changes to `{"ENV DEST" -> "ENV 1 MOD"?, {P_ED_FLT, P_E1PIT, P_ED_SHP, P_E1X}}`. Cards are
  labelled and redirected per engine through the `env1[]` table (in `page_desc`/`track_desc`, the same way E1..E8 get
  names). Alias cards show the EDIT value. SLOOP's UI uses the same PAGES, so it changes too. ENV, ENV2 and ENV2 DEST
  are unchanged.
* Optimist UI: `op_effval.c` 127-140 (ENV slots in the effective-value display) reads the depths. `op_graph.c` and
  `op_names.c` need relabels. `ui_draw`, `ui_layers`, `ui_menu` and `ui_overview` (SLOOP) need a re-check.
* `tools/param_help.json`: ENV DEST becomes per-engine card help (about 16 x 4 short lines; `gen_param_help.py`).
* Web editor: the Sound cards are descriptor-driven, so labels come from the device. Regenerate the mock tables
  (`tests/scrs_table.json`, `tools/gen_fxp_table.py`) and update `web/test_web.mjs`, `web/EDITOR_PROTOCOL.md` (same ids,
  new meaning: bump INFO's version so an old editor does not send DST values) and editor.html's file conversion.
* `docs/guide/sound.md` §"ENV and ENV 2" / §"Destinations": ENV 1 gets fixed depths and a per-engine table. The
  "AMP 127 default" rule goes away. `docs/UI-OPTIMIST-DESIGN.md` needs the ENV page update.

## 5. Audio engine, cost, risk

* **voice.c.** `env_plan`: the k=0 slot loop is replaced by `am[0][EA_FLT]=2*P_ED_FLT`, `am[0][EA_SHP]=2*P_ED_SHP`,
  `am[0][EA_PIT]=P_E1PIT`, and `E1X` as one `mv_*` entry (an E-move). `env_plain` becomes "ENV 2 off, E1PIT=0, E1X=0".
  The plain RAM path keeps today's FLT/SHP arithmetic and drops the AMP-gain branch, so RAMTEXT is the same or a few
  bytes smaller. PIT and E1X run only on the slow path (XIP `env_post`/`env_vmove`), so **0 B of new RAMTEXT**.
  **0 B of new RAM**: the values sit in existing `t->p` words and `env_plan_t` is unchanged. The engine tables are
  flash. The env_store.h ENV 1 half and its `env1_from_depths` shrink to a load-only fold. This fits the 276 B RAM
  margin (the brief's figure, not re-measured here).
* **Cost per voice.** The default (depths only) costs the same as today's plain path. E1PIT adds one multiply per voice
  per block. An E-move costs what an ENV slot on E-n costs today. The CPU guard (`cpuguard_costs.h`) has no modulation
  term today, so nothing changes there. Measure `env_dest_test`'s slow path in the batch costs.json run.
* **JUNO.** `ENV1_FLT_AMT(p)` becomes `2*p[P_ED_FLT]` (the same numbers).
* **Risks.**
  * Post-141 user sounds that used ENV 1 freely: some are re-routed or lost (see §3).
  * ENV 1 AMP below 127 can no longer be expressed.
  * ACID, CZ and FM6 ENV 1 cards are aliases, so turning them changes the sound on the EDIT page too (by design).
  * E-move cards on engines where ENV 1 is a gate (WHEEL) follow the ADSR.
  * Factory presets: no change, because the fold of A=AMP127 + B=FLT/SHP gives back the exact depths.

## 6. Plan (slices) and tests

| Slice | Content | Reserve |
|---|---|---|
| E1 | core: ids repurposed (P_E1PIT, P_E1X, 2 reserved), env_plan/env_plain, the `env1[]` per-engine table in engine_t, JUNO macro | no builder item (core behaviour; ENV 2 stays under ANALOG2) |
| E2 | storage: MREC_TAG 0xD3 + the 0xD2 fold, UP_VER 4, sections/locks conversion, sl24_export, ed_backup | MREC tag 0xD3, UP_VER 4 |
| E3 | UI: PAGES, page_desc labels/aliases, op_effval/op_graph, SLOOP pages, param_help | none |
| E4 | editor: INFO bump, file conversion, mock tables, test_web | INFO version +1 |
| E5 | docs: sound.md, UI-OPTIMIST-DESIGN.md | none |

Tests:
* **Golden renders** (`tests/golden.txt`, regress.c; golden_cz/juno/noise) **should not change**, because every preset
  folds back to its depths. Any golden diff is a bug. They change only where the user picks a different card meaning
  for an engine whose default moves away from 0.
* `env_dest_test.c` is rewritten as `env1_test.c`. Per engine, for every card: at 0 the render is bit-equal to a
  zero-depth render. For path cards, +-63 moves the expected path (cutoff, shape, pitch Hz). E-moves change the named
  value per voice and restore it after render. Alias cards equal the EDIT value.
* Migration tests in project_test, upreset_test, sl25_upreset_test and motion_sections_test: fixtures from 141..now with
  ENV 1 on AMP/FLT/SHP/PIT/RES/E3/PAN, and with ENV 2 free and busy. Check the lost count and the copied ADSR.
* ui_pages_test and ui_optimist_test: labels per engine. test_web: mock table.

## 7. Open questions (short, per engine; recommended first)

1. ANALOG/TRIO/JUNO/NOISE card 4: **RES** / DRV / NOIS(ANALOG) / none?
2. DIGITAL: **IDX PIT FB MDEC** / IDX PIT only (2 cards blank)?
3. FM6: **M.TIM C.TIM MOD PIT** (aliases + paths) / a new "PEG depth" card in place of PIT / MOD PIT only? (Settled 2026-10-18 by the FM6 cut: those EDIT values are gone; PIT alone.)
4. ACID: **aliases ENV DEC ACC CUT** / leave ENV 1 blank on ACID (303 untouched)?
5. CZ: **aliases DCW W.TIM A.TIM + PIT** / PIT only?
6. WHEEL: **PIT DRV CLICK TOP** / PIT only?
7. PHASE: **DCW (alias E3) PIT DTN SUB** / FLT-path DCW depth as a new knob?
8. Post-141 ENV 1 slots on other targets: **move to ENV 2 when it is free (copy the ADSR)** / always drop with a note?
9. Page name: **ENV 1 MOD** / ENV DEST (kept) / DEPTH?

## 8. As built (feat/env1-fixed, 2026-10-16)

The user's rulings: every recommended answer of §7 (ANALOG TRIO JUNO NOISE card 4 RES; DIGITAL IDX PIT FB MDEC; FM6
PIT alone for FM6 (was M.TIM C.TIM MOD PIT until 2026-10-18); ACID the aliases ENV DEC ACC CUT; CZ DCW W.TIM A.TIM + PIT; WHEEL PIT DRV CLICK TOP; PHASE DCW PIT
DTN SUB; ENV 1 slots on other targets moved to ENV 2 when it is free, else dropped and counted; the page ENV 1 MOD).
Then (the user, the same day): "in general we should always have filter and amp, by default slot 1 of env2 is filter".

Where the build differs from §1 to §6:

* **Ids.** All four ids of ENV DEST are kept for the cards: `P_E1PIT` (PIT), `P_E1X`, `P_E1Y`, `P_E1Z` (the first,
  second and third move card of an engine). §3 had `P_N1DB`/`P_N1AB` reserved, but the approved card sets need up to
  three moves (WHEEL: DRV CLICK TOP; DIGITAL, PHASE, LOFI, SAMPLE, SLICE, PHYS: two). No id moves, P_COUNT is the same.
* **The table** (`firmware/src/core/env1_cards.h`): per engine slot four cards {kind, the value it keeps, its name}
  and ENV 2's default DEST A. Kinds: FLT SHP PIT (paths), a move (`env_vmove`, per voice), a **part move** (WHEEL: its
  DRV CLICK TOP are read once a block in `drawbar_block`, so ENV 1 moves them for the block from the part's newest
  voice, as an ENV 2 slot on PAN), an alias. A card's name is the engine's EDIT value it moves (its own label) or FLT,
  PIT, SHP; an alias shows the EDIT value itself (PHASE's alias of E3 is named ENV there, as on EDIT). ACID's cards: ENV DEC ACC SLD (§7's CUT moved to the
  shared FLT destination, below).
* **Labels on the page.** JUNO's FLT card is named FLT (not VCF ENV); TRIO's and ANALOG's are FLT; the others take
  the EDIT value they drive (DIGITAL IDX, LOFI TONE, SAMPLE CUT, VOICE VOWL, GRAIN TONE, SLICE TONE, PHYS BRIT, NOISE
  FREQ). The descriptors are made when the page asks (four in the pool, `params.c e1_card_desc`): no flash table of
  names.
* **The render** keeps FLT and SHP on every engine as before 2026-10-14 (`env x d >> 7`, the plain path), whether or
  not the engine has that card: an old project's depth plays as it did. PIT and the moves run on the slow path.
* **E1 AMT.** An LFO on it scales ENV 1's FLT and SHP depths for the block (x 0..2, kept in -64..63); ENV 2 on it
  scales FLT SHP PIT for each voice. The moves are not scaled (as before).
* **Fold** (`env_store.h env1_fold`): AMP dropped (an AMT other than 127 counted), FLT SHP PIT at AMT / 2; everything
  else (RES and E1..E8 too) to ENV 2's slots when both do nothing, ENV's ATK DEC SUS REL copied into ATK2 DEC2 SUS2
  REL2; else lost. Lost slots of a project load show in TOOLS > MISS as "ENV DEST T1". User presets UP_VER 3 fold the
  same way (no note).
* **Not done** (flash): §3's DIGITAL / PHASE tidy of old FLT / SHP depths. They keep playing as they did; on DIGITAL
  the SHP depth acts with no card (it is the same index as IDX), on PHASE FLT and SHP act beside the DCW card.

### ENV 2's default destination

ENV 2's DEST A is FLT on a new sound, on INIT and on every factory preset that does not use ENV 2, at AMT 0: the
filter is one turn away. ENV 2's DEST B stays OFF. Checked in each engine's render (not only the mod path):

| Engine | its filter | its amplitude | ENV 2's default DEST A |
|---|---|---|---|
| ACID | **has its own** (the 303's CUT, RESO; ENV DEC ACC). The shared FLT destination now drives CUT and RES drives RESO (eng_acid.c, 2026-10-16) | its own VCA / VEG: the shared AMP path does not drive it (the ADSR only gates) | FLT (its CUT) |
| CZ | has none (the DCW waveshaping, with its own DCW envelope, is its timbre control) | its own DCA envelope (cz_amp): the shared AMP path does not drive it | E2 (DCW) |
| FM6 | has none (Dexed's DC blocker only) | its operators' EGs, and the shared amplitude on top (amp_at) | SHP (MOD, the modulator levels) |
| WHEEL | has none (additive organ) | the shared amplitude (amp_at), the organ gate | TOP (E4, the top bars) |
| PHASE | has none: the FLT path drives the DCW depth | the shared amplitude | FLT (the DCW depth) |
| DIGITAL | has none: the FLT path drives the FM index | the shared amplitude | FLT (the index) |

Every other engine has a filter the shared FLT path drives (ANALOG, SUPER, LOFI TONE, SAMPLE CUT, VOICE VOWL formants,
TRIO, GRAIN TONE, SLICE TONE, PHYS BRIT, JUNO VCF, NOISE FREQ) and the shared amplitude. No filter was added to an
engine that has none. Old files keep the destinations they stored.

ACID's ENV 1 cards, in the 303's grammar: ENV (env mod), DEC (decay), ACC (accent), SLD (slide time): the four values
of its own envelopes and glide (aliases of its EDIT values). CUT and RES stay EDIT's main filter controls (RES is not an
envelope depth); an LFO or ENV 2 reaches them through FLT and RES.

### Findings for the user

* **SLICE's START card did nothing** (START is read once, at the note-on, when ENV 1 is 0). The user's ruling: card 4 is
  PTCH (E3, read each block), heard in env1_test with SLICE's BREAK in the headers.
* **Locks and motion** (the user's ruling): ENV 1's PIT and its three moves are lockable and recorded as motion, stored
  as tail ids P_ENG_END + 15 .. + 18 (seq/auto.c MOT_TAIL; an older build keeps such events and plays none). FLT and SHP
  are lockable as their own values again (they were LFO-slot events of before only in 2026-10-14 .. 16).
* Old DIGITAL / PHASE FLT and SHP depths keep playing as built (the user's ruling).
* WHEEL, FM6, CZ, PHASE, DIGITAL have no filter; ACID has its own (now driven by FLT / RES); ACID and CZ have their
  own amplitude envelopes that the shared AMP path does not drive; see the table above.
