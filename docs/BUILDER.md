# Firmware builder

Pick the engines, FX, drum kits, sample sets and features that go into your FM-1 firmware, with a live flash,
RAM, pool and RAMTEXT budget, then build it: in the browser at [w0ts.github.io/optimist](https://w0ts.github.io/optimist/)
(Build tab: a cloud build, nothing to install), or on your computer with `make builder`. The memory map (flash areas,
RAM regions): `docs/MEMORY-MAP.md`; the budget behind the trade-offs: `docs/MEMORY-BUDGET.md`.

The sizes are measured builds (`make costs-all`, tools/builder/costs.json); the CPU figures come from the emulator.

## Run it

```sh
python tools/optimist.py setup                    # once: the venv, the SDK files, the toolchain (BUILDING.md)
python tools/optimist.py builder                  # the interactive menu (Textual)
python tools/optimist.py builder --profile drum-machine   # the menu, starting from a profile
python tools/optimist.py builder --config my.config       # the menu on a saved configuration
```

`tools/optimist.py` runs the same on macOS, Linux and Windows. On macOS and Linux `tools/menuconfig` (and
`make builder`) still work and call it.

Keys: `space` / `enter` toggle (a sized item: its next value), `/` search, `p` profiles (shipped + yours), `s` save as your own profile (config/my-profiles, git-ignored; then `--profile NAME` works too), `u` publish the profile or not (CI builds the published ones; one of yours is moved to config/profiles first, to commit), `d` delete a profile (type yes; never user-default), `w` write a .config file, `l` load,
`o` sort the items by size (cycles: registry order, flash, RAM, pool, RAM code; largest first within each group, kept for the session; items without a measured cost last), `b` build, `e` build and run the new firmware in the emulator (96 MHz, in the background), `f` Flash to FM-1 (below), `x` / `c` expand / collapse all, `left` / `right` (like `page up` / `page down`) page the list, `q` quit. The menu opens with every item that has options expanded; what you collapse stays collapsed when the list is rebuilt (a search, a profile change), and a search expands the matches.

The bars show the estimate from the measured deltas (`tools/builder/costs.json`), red with "OVER by n" when a
region overflows; the message panel then names the biggest items of that region. `b` runs the real build
(about 10 s): the exact sizes replace the estimate, and when it fits the package is `build/felucca.fwsc`, with
its web editor sidecar `build/felucca-ui.zip` (index.html, the font and its licence, SOURCE.txt: the commit and
the configuration's hash; the emulator's fm1-ui serves it beside the firmware).

**Flash to FM-1.** After a build that fits, the panel says `f: Flash to FM-1`. `f` reads the running identity of the connected
FM-1 (`tools/fm1_install.py --info`) and opens a confirmation screen with it, the package (this menu's last build,
`build/optimist-*.fwsc`), the commit and configuration it was built from (its SOURCE.txt; a NOTE when the checkout has
moved on since), and how to recover (README.md, "Getting back"); *Cancel* is the first line and escape cancels, so nothing is written
before you pick *Flash to FM-1*. Then it runs `fm1_install.py PACKAGE --yes` (the web installer's update; never `--force`) and the
panel shows the result. No FM-1 found, mido or python-rtmidi missing (`make setup` installs them into the venv), a package that is not an
Optimist build: refused in the panel. `f` flashes only a package this menu built of the configuration it shows, with
the builder code it runs (`tools/builder/stamp.py`): no build yet in this menu, a configuration changed since the build
(a profile loaded or edited, an item toggled), the package replaced by another build in the checkout, or the builder's
own files changed on disk since it started (the panel then says THIS BUILDER IS OUT OF DATE: quit and run `make builder`
again): FLASH REFUSED, nothing read or written; never an older `build/optimist-*.fwsc`. (2026-10-12: a menu left open
for 21 hours flashed a 4-hour-old build of another commit and an older profile as "the last build", and the FM-1 went to
its USB rescue.) The builder builds the checkout it runs in, at the commit it is on (no branch choice); the top line
and every build's result show `source: <path> <branch>@<commit>`. The same without the menu:
`python tools/optimist.py flash [PACKAGE.fwsc]` / `make flash` (BUILDING.md; it builds first when no package is named,
and shows the package's commit too). In the menu, b and f show a progress bar under the panels: the build's five stages
(toolchain and config, generators and loader, app, checks, package), then the flash (checking the package, switching to
update mode, writing, restarting); f with no current build of the configuration shown builds it first, then asks.

A configuration error marks the lines of the items it concerns as soon as it holds, in red after the item
(`✗ the drum track needs a drum source: …`; an option's error marks its parent too, in case it is folded),
and the message panel lists it; fixing it clears the marks at once. `b` on an invalid configuration still
says CANNOT BUILD in the panel and keeps it there, like a build's result, until the next `b`.
(`configure.validate()` returns each message as an `Issue`: a string with `.keys`, the items it names.)

Without the menu (scripts, tests, CI): `python tools/optimist.py build | package | config ...` (BUILDING.md,
"Quick start"), for example

```sh
python tools/optimist.py package --config my.config --out dist --summary dist/result.json   # exit 0 = built and fits
```

or, as before on macOS and Linux:

```sh
tools/menuconfig --list                               # the registry with the default values
tools/menuconfig --profile fm-va-studio --budget      # estimate
tools/menuconfig --profile fm-va-studio --set FX_PUNCH=0 --write my.config
tools/menuconfig --config my.config --build           # real build: exact sizes, the package if it fits
tools/menuconfig --profile everything-that-fits --fit # drop items (least loss first) until it fits
sh build.sh --config my.config                        # the same build, directly
tools/menuconfig --profile drum-machine --package ~/GitHub/fm1-firmware   # optimist-drum-machine-<date>.fwsc + -ui.zip
```

The old environment switches still work and override the `.config` (`FELUCCA_ICONS=0 sh build.sh`).

## Published profiles

A shipped profile (`config/profiles`) with the line `# publish: yes` is built by CI
(`.github/workflows/build.yml` takes the list from `config --published`); `# publish: no` or no line: not built.
Your own profiles (`config/my-profiles`) are git-ignored, so CI never sees them: share one first (it moves to
`config/profiles`), then publish it, and commit the file.

```sh
make profiles                       # python tools/optimist.py config --profiles
make share PROFILE=my-groove        # config --share my-groove
make publish PROFILE=my-groove      # config --publish my-groove   (unpublish: --unpublish)
make delete PROFILE=my-groove       # config --delete my-groove    (mine first, else the shipped one)
```

In the menu: load the profile (`p`), then `u` (shares one of yours first).

**The default profile is `synth` (Optimist Synth, the maintainer's own build).** `build`, `package`, `flash`, `config`
and `make` without a profile use it, the menu opens with it the first time (afterwards where you left off), and it is the
Pages site's flavour (`web/flavours.json`). It is the maintainer's own configuration as it is (2026-10-18): against
`user-default` it has the X0X drums, the ACID, JUNO and PHYS engines, all five FM6 voice packs, BLE, UI=1, DUAL and USB
audio on, and most sample sets, the sampled kits and the web editor's live editing (`ED_LIVE`, so every `ED_*`) off: the
editor backs up and restores. `user-default` is the generic
reference profile, not the default: the host tests, the gate, `emu-check` and CI's fixtures build it, so its content stays
as it is. `synth` and `user-default` cannot be deleted. `--defaults` is still every registry default.

## What is switchable

`tools/builder/registry.py` is the list; `tools/menuconfig --list` prints it. One level only: a top-level
item and its own options (FM6's modes, the sampled kits, the delay length...); an option is ignored while its
parent is off, and no option depends on another item.

| Group | Items |
|---|---|
| Reserve | keep at least 0 / 4 / 8 / 16 / 32 KB of undo history; keep at least 0 / 8 / 16 / 32 / 64 KB of app flash free (settings of the build, not firmware; below) |
| Synth engines | ANALOG 2, DIGITAL, PHASE, LOFI, SAMPLE, VOICE, TRIO, WHEEL, GRAIN, FM6, SLICE, PHYS, ACID, CZ, JUNO, NOISE (at least one) |
| FM6 options | black-key editor, DX7 SysEx in (receive only), five voice packs of 16 (keys and e-pianos, basses, bells and mallets, pads / leads / brass / FX, 80s mega classics; off by default), user presets that keep their voice (UP_FM6, Felucca 1.0.3 idea) |
| Drums | drum synth (all synthesised kits: one switch), sampled drums (one switch per kit), sound editor, user samples on lanes, user kits (at least one drum source; each lane's REV / DLY / CHO sends are in every build, no longer an item); the X0X 909 kit (its ride and crash samples: 8-bit, 6-bit or none) and the X0X 808 kit (their voices also on any lane; four style kits each, UIDs 39..46) (EXPERIMENTAL, off by default; see below) |
| Sample sets | PIANO, BASS, VIBES, HORNS, STRINGS, FLUTE, SCRATCH (PERC goes with the sampled kits) |
| FX (two groups: any number on every track; limited instances) | insert copies CHRS (chorus) and ECHO (short delay) with a count of instances each, DIST, chorus, delay (length; halving when longer than the line), reverb (one checkbox per algorithm: ROOM, PLATE, FDN8, SPRING, at least one; two or more: TYPE on the device and in the web editor; one shared line buffer; half rate at 22.05 kHz; its buffers in the pool instead of main RAM), SLICER (capture), PUNCH (ring; its LATCH, Felucca 1.0.2 #40), DJ filter, DUST, DUCK, BASS+, mixer glides (X0X 0.10.1, EXPERIMENTAL) |
| MIDI & USB | USB port: CDC console / USB audio (EXPERIMENTAL; its resampler) / MIDI only; TRS MIDI IN; MIDI clock; MIDI expression; always built: USB MIDI flow control, TRS input past line noise (SLOOP 2.3) |
| Sequencer | song sections (16 / 8 / 4), snapshots (0 / 2 / 4 / 8 whole-state slots), undo history, per-step chance, QNT SEQ, motion recording (its card mark, Felucca 1.0.2 #63), performance macros (GLO > MACRO; its ENERGY bands), the REC screen's dials and count-in (SLOOP 2.3) |
| UI | the user interface (SLOOP's, or the Optimist UI), parameter icons, VIEW ALL overview (4 x 4 PAGEs; its ARP graph), the MISSING message, favorites (FAVORITES: PRESETS KNOB 3 FAV, KNOB 4 LIST), the knob's help line (PARAM_HELP), chord names on the STEP page (isod89/sloop-fm1 PR #45), the drum step sequencer (DRUM_STEP), knob acceleration, screen SPI clock, changed-rectangle screen updates, keys lit by the notes played, brightness, LIGHTS / KEYS / NOTES (SLOOP 2.3), BPM LOCK, divisions in length order (Felucca 1.0.2 #58, #48); always built, no choices: the boot logo (the Optimist dinghy; the SPLASH item was retired 2026-10-15, there is no ring-only logo and no off), the keys read with their column (SLOOP 2.3), the knobs' decoder (Felucca 1.6), knobs quiet as a layer is let go (Felucca 1.0.2 #39) |
| System | web editor (EDITOR), backup / restore (firmware updates and the USB rescue are in every build, no choice: until 2026-10-17 they were one item with the editor, OTA, and a build without it could only be updated through UBOOT; a .config's OTA= loads as EDITOR=; the CPU sleep between polls and the size-optimised UI, storage and editor code are always built, no choices; so are these fixes of SLOOP 2.3: no stuck note after a VOICE change, stricter flash read-back, the overload fade, a restore checked object by object; and every synth track's second LFO, LFO 2, with its pages LFO 2 and LFO2 DEST: always on, the LFO2 item was retired 2026-10-16, a .config naming it loads, warns and ignores it), assembly speed-ups (ASM; the packed 16-bit SIMD maths are no longer offered: wrong on the real FM-1, 2026-10-12, a .config naming SIMD loads, warns and builds without it), predictive CPU guard (off; docs/CPU-GUARD.md) |

The X0X kits' UIDs (37, 38) and names are in every build, built or not: a project or kit naming one keeps it,
plays a stand-in, and the MISSING warning names it. That base saves 128 B of flash on user-default (581,424 against
581,552): the kits' names and the drum lanes' source names are one table (drums.c DRUM_SRC_NAMES), and the stand-in
choice is one out-of-line drum_kit_of. With DRUM_X0X909 and DRUM_X0X808 at 0, felucca.bin and data.bin are
byte-identical to that base (compared on user-default and drum-machine) but for one word, FELUCCA_CFG_HASH: the
configuration's hash, which now covers the two new items.

Errors: no drum source. Warnings the menu gives: FM6 without its editor and
without SysEx has no voice editing; FM6 with neither a pack nor SysEx has INIT VOICE only; sample sets without SAMPLE or GRAIN
play nowhere; SAMPLE / GRAIN without their presets' sets get a preset of their own (below); EDITOR off removes the
web editor (installing and the USB rescue stay); an experimental item's warning says what it has been tested on.

Every engine a build has keeps at least one entry on the PRESETS list (and in the web editor's preset list), and
every drum source at least one kit. An engine with no factory preset this build can play (none in its table, or
none whose sample set is built) shows one entry, INIT: loading it sets the engine's and the sound's defaults, as a
fresh track on that engine. INIT is made from the defaults: no preset data, no flash in a build that does not need
it. GRAIN without PIANO, VIBES and FLUTE but with another melodic set gets a real preset instead, GRAIN PAD on the
first of them (its sound beats a silent INIT); SAMPLE with no set at all, or GRAIN with no melodic set, plays only
the USR slots: INIT.

### Every item, in plain words

What each item does for you, what it costs and what you lose when it is off: the text of the menu's details panel
(`desc` in `tools/builder/registry.py`, `tools/builder/backports.py`), one table a group. Sizes are about, from
`tools/builder/costs.json`; a `(sub-item)` is an option of the item above it, ignored while that item is off.
Items marked EXPERIMENTAL (USB audio, TAB_IN_POOL) are emulator-tested only, except where their text says more. The `tests/builder_test.py` check keeps every item described.

#### Reserve

Two settings at the top of the menu, for a user who prefers headroom to a device filled to the last byte. They are part
of the configuration (`builder.config`, saved with it and with a profile) and change nothing in the firmware: no
flag, no code, no flash, RAM or pool (their `costs.json` deltas are 0, written by `measure_costs.py` without a build),
and not in the configuration's hash or the BUILD report's bits, so a build with a reserve is byte-identical to the
same build without it.

| Item | Key | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| keep at least this much undo history | `RESERVE_UNDO_KB` | Keeps headroom for the undo history instead of filling RAM and pool to the last byte: the history's ring is what they leave free ((98,304 - RAM) + (344,064 - 8,192 - pool), docs/MEMORY-MAP.md). The estimate shows the ring and warns below this figure; a build whose real ring is smaller is refused. Nothing in the firmware changes (it needs the undo / redo history item). |
| keep at least this much app flash free | `RESERVE_FLASH_KB` | Keeps room in the app slot for later (a feature, an update) instead of filling it to the last byte: the budget subtracts it from the slot and a build that leaves less free is refused. Nothing in the firmware changes. |

- **Undo.** Free main RAM and pool become the undo history's ring (`docs/MEMORY-MAP.md` section 2.1), so the more a
  configuration uses, the fewer undo levels it keeps. The estimate shows the ring it leaves, (98,304 - RAM) +
  (344,064 - 8,192 - pool): an `UNDO` line under the bars, in red with a message below the figure you keep. The
  estimate only warns (it is +-0.5 %); `tools/build.py` refuses a build whose real ring (`undo history ring` in its
  output, FELUCCA_UNDO_CAP included) is smaller, as it already refuses a ring under 1 KiB. Keeping undo needs the undo
  / redo history item (an error otherwise: without it there is a single level).
- **Flash.** The budget subtracts the figure from the app slot (581,564 B): the flash bar's capacity shrinks, the fit
  solver and the menu's "fits" test use it, and `tools/build.py` refuses a build that leaves less free.
- A measurement build (`--measure`) never ships, so it keeps no reserve.

#### Synth engines

| Item | Key | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| ANALOG 2 (analog-style synth, swarm, 2 filters) | `ENG_ANALOG` | The main subtractive synth: two oscillators with hard sync, a swarm of up to 6 detuned copies (supersaw), two filters. About 6 KB of flash and 4.7 KB of fast RAM code; it is also the stand-in that most other engines fall back to, so keep it unless you need the space. |
| DIGITAL (4-operator FM) | `ENG_DIGITAL` | Four-operator FM synth: 8 classic algorithms, feedback on operator 4 and one modulation INDEX with its own envelope. About 2 KB of flash; the stand-in for FM6 when FM6 is left out. |
| PHASE (phase distortion) | `ENG_PHASE` | Phase-distortion synth: bends the phase of a cosine wave to get saw, square, pulse and resonant shapes with a second line to mix or ring-modulate. About 1.4 KB of flash; the stand-in for CZ. |
| LOFI (chip sounds, wavetable) | `ENG_LOFI` | Chip voice: pulse, triangle, saw, noise and a 4-bit wavetable, with a few-bit amplitude, a held (low) sample rate and a pitch sweep. About 2 KB of flash. |
| SAMPLE (sample sets, USR slots) | `ENG_SAMPLE` | Plays the built-in sample sets and your own samples (USR1..USR3 slots) across the keyboard, with loops. About 1.4 KB of flash plus the sets you keep (see Sample sets); it is also the stand-in for GRAIN and SLICE. |
| VOICE (formant, sung vowels) | `ENG_FORMANT` | Formant synth that sings vowels from the keyboard (4 voices; BUZZ and BREATH shape the voice). About 2.7 KB of flash; a special sound, leave it out if you need the space. |
| TRIO (3 oscillators) | `ENG_TRIO` | Three oscillators with ring modulation and hard sync into a multimode filter, in the style of early 8-bit home-computer sound chips. About 3.4 KB of flash. |
| WHEEL (drawbar organ) | `ENG_DRAWBAR` | Tonewheel-style organ: nine sine drawbars per note, 16 registrations to choose from. About 2.3 KB of flash and 2.5 KB of RAM. |
| GRAIN (granular on the sample sets) | `ENG_GRAIN` | Granular synth: plays clouds of tiny grains cut from the sample sets or your USR slots. About 4.9 KB of flash and 21 KB of pool; with no sample set built it plays your USR samples only. |
| FM6 (DX7, bit-exact with Dexed) | `ENG_FM6` | Six-operator FM that plays Yamaha DX7 voices the way the Dexed plug-in does (MSFA, bit for bit), with its own operator editor and DX7 SysEx in; INIT VOICE and the voice packs below are its sounds. The biggest engine: about 28 KB of flash and 6 KB of RAM; its options below trim it down. |
| (sub-item) FM6 operator editor on the black keys | `FM6_KEYS` | Edit a DX7 voice on the device: hold ENV and press a black key to pick an operator, the pitch envelope or the global page, then turn the knobs. About 6.3 KB of flash; off: a voice can only be replaced by DX7 SysEx. |
| (sub-item) FM6 DX7 SysEx in (a voice, a 32-voice bank) | `FM6_SYSEX` | Receives DX7 SysEx over USB MIDI, from Dexed or any DX7 librarian: a single voice replaces the selected FM6 track's voice (then SAVE AS keeps it as a user preset), a 32-voice bank becomes a pick list at the end of that track's PRESETS (RAM only, until power-off) to audition and SAVE AS. Nothing is sent back. About 1.3 KB of flash and 4.3 KB of pool RAM for the frame buffers. |
| (sub-item) FM6 voice pack: keys and e-pianos (16) | `FM6_PK_KEYS` | 16 voices of my own for the FM6 track, listed in its PRESETS after the user presets (K01..K16): electric pianos, clavs, organs, a harpsichord. About 2.0-2.3 KB of flash. |
| (sub-item) FM6 voice pack: basses (16) | `FM6_PK_BASS` | 16 bass voices for the FM6 track, listed in its PRESETS after the user presets (B01..B16): slap, fretless, synth, pluck and sub basses. About 2.0-2.3 KB of flash. |
| (sub-item) FM6 voice pack: bells and mallets (16) | `FM6_PK_BELLS` | 16 voices for the FM6 track, listed in its PRESETS after the user presets (M01..M16): bells, marimba, vibes, kalimba, steel drum, glass and chimes. About 2.0-2.3 KB of flash. |
| (sub-item) FM6 voice pack: pads, leads, brass and FX (16) | `FM6_PK_PADS` | 16 voices for the FM6 track, listed in its PRESETS after the user presets (P01..P16): pads, leads, brass, strings and effect sounds. About 2.0-2.3 KB of flash. |
| (sub-item) FM6 voice pack: 80s mega classics (16) | `FM6_PK_80S` | 16 recreations of the famous 80s DX sounds (the e-piano, the bass, the bells, the brass, the marimba, the harmonica ...) for the FM6 track, listed in its PRESETS after the user presets (801..816). All programmed from scratch, none copied from a ROM or a cartridge. About 2.0-2.3 KB of flash. |
| (sub-item) FM6 user presets keep their voice | `UP_FM6` | FM6 user presets keep their whole voice (operator edits included) instead of only the VOICE number. About 0.7 KB of flash plus a 3.6 KB store in flash; a preset written from the web editor drops its kept voice. |
| CZ native tone collection in PRESETS | `NATIVE_BANKS` | With CZ built, a CZ track's PRESETS list ends with a collection of 26 CZ-1 tones (the web editor imports and exports Casio .syx). Loading one sets only the engine's values: the track keeps its FX, mix and pattern. The collection takes 8 KiB at USR3's end (USR3 holds that much less). About 2 KB of flash with CZ (measured); no RAM. (The FM6 user bank U01..U32 that this item once listed went 2026-10-18; FM6's own list is its voice packs and a received DX7 bank, with FM6_SYSEX or a pack.) |
| SLICE (break slicer + its BREAK sample) | `ENG_SLICE` | Break slicer: cuts a loop (the built-in BREAK, 22 KB of samples, or a USR slot) into 4 / 8 / 16 / 32 slices or one per hit and plays them from the keys or the sequencer. About 27 KB of flash and 6 KB of RAM; off by default. |
| PHYS (physical models) | `ENG_PHYS` | Physical-modelling engine (engine 11): modal, string, membrane and sympathetic-string models, 3 voices per part. Heavy: about 9.8 KB of flash and 38.7 KB of pool, and 3 voices of its heaviest preset take about 17 % of the audio budget at 312 MHz (at 96 MHz that was too much and voices were shed). |
| ACID (TB-303 bass + line generator) | `ENG_ACID` | X0X's TB-303-style bass voice (one monophonic voice per part, engine 12) with the TB-3PO line generator. Floating-point DSP (about 14.4 KB of flash, 1.7 KB of RAM) that ran on a real FM-1 in X0X; no pitch bend or TUNE on the 303; 4 presets. |
| NOISE (colours, crackle, shift-register noise) | `ENG_NOISE` | Noise engine from Felucca-Engines (engine 15, MIT): white, pink and brown noise, crackle (DUST), a shift register clocked above the key (LFSR) and short-sequence metal tones (META), through a resonant filter that morphs from low-pass to band-pass, with key tracking, a slow random drift and a bit crusher; 4 presets. About 3 KB of flash, no RAM; 1.1..1.3 K host instructions a sample with 8 voices (the heaviest ANALOG preset: 1.7 K). |
| CZ (CZ-1 style tones) | `ENG_CZ` | Casio CZ-1 style engine from Melodee 0.11 (engine 13): two lines with 8-step envelopes, 8 built-in tones (TONE) changed by the EDIT values; no envelope editing, banks or SysEx yet. About 7 KB of flash and 3.1 KB of RAM; similar CPU to FM6 (emulator). |
| JUNO (Juno-106 voice) | `ENG_JUNO` | Juno-106 voice from fm-106 / KR-106 (engine 14): the DCO (saw, pulse, sub, noise), the 4-pole OTA ladder filter and the 4-position HPF; the track's ENV and LFO drive it; 6 voices, 8 patches of our own (no Roland factory patches). About 2x the CPU of an ANALOG voice. |

#### Drums

| Item | Key | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| drum synth (all 32 synthesised kits) | `DRUM_SYNTH` | The 32 synthesised drum kits (808, 909 and others), generated by the firmware, so they take no sample memory. About 13.7 KB of flash; the drum track needs this or at least one sampled kit. |
| sampled drums (the PERC set, 99 KB) | `DRUM_SAMPLED` | The recorded drum samples (the PERC set, about 99 KB of flash) behind the five sampled kits below. Switching this off drops all of them; the drum track then needs the drum synth. |
| (sub-item) sampled kit ACOUSTIC | `KIT_ACOUSTIC` | The sampled kit as recorded (the basic kit of the PERC set). It shares the PERC samples with the other sampled kits, so leaving it out saves no memory (only leaving out all of them does); a project using it plays another kit. |
| (sub-item) sampled kit DEEP | `KIT_DEEP` | The sampled kit tuned down and softened by a low-pass filter: a darker, heavier kit. It shares the PERC samples with the other sampled kits, so leaving it out saves no memory (only leaving out all of them does); a project using it plays another kit. |
| (sub-item) sampled kit TIGHT | `KIT_TIGHT` | The sampled kit with every hit cut short by a fast decay: a dry, punchy kit. It shares the PERC samples with the other sampled kits, so leaving it out saves no memory (only leaving out all of them does); a project using it plays another kit. |
| (sub-item) sampled kit BRIGHT | `KIT_BRIGHT` | The sampled kit tuned two semitones up: a lighter kit. It shares the PERC samples with the other sampled kits, so leaving it out saves no memory (only leaving out all of them does); a project using it plays another kit. |
| (sub-item) sampled kit DUST | `KIT_DUST` | The sampled kit tuned slightly down, filtered and reduced to a coarse bit depth: a gritty lo-fi kit. It shares the PERC samples with the other sampled kits, so leaving it out saves no memory (only leaving out all of them does); a project using it plays another kit. |
| drum sound editor (EDIT on the drum track) | `DRUM_EDIT` | Per-lane sound tweaks over the kit (TUNE, DECAY, SNAP, CLICK, BEND, CUT, DRIVE, LEVEL on synthesised kits; TUNE, DECAY, CUT, LEVEL on sampled ones). About 1.2 KB of flash; off: kits play as they are and saved tweaks are kept but not applied. |
| user samples on drum lanes | `DRUM_USR` | A drum lane can play one of your own samples (a hit of a USR slot, with start and length) instead of the kit's sound. About 1.2 KB of flash; off: such lanes play the kit sound. |
| user drum kits (bank of 16 in data flash) | `DRUM_KITS` | Lane sources from other kits and the X0X machines, and a bank of 16 user kits (each lane's source and sound tweaks) saved in flash. About 2.8 KB of flash; off: lanes play the kit as it is. |
| X0X 909 kit (circuit-modelled TR-909) | `DRUM_X0X909` | X0X's TR-909 drum kit (kit UID 37; the drum models are circuit-modelled, hi-hats, ride and crash are samples), on the 16 lanes; SHAKER, CONGA, COWBELL play the synthesised 909's. Big: about 151 KB of flash (see its cymbal option) and uses floating point. A build without it plays the synthesised 909 for it and keeps the kit |
| (sub-item) X0X 909: ride and crash sample quality | `X909_CYM` | 8-bit block floating point as before; 6-bit: 22 KB less, 30 dB against the 16-bit source instead of 42 (screens x0xdrums-perf-2026-10-06); off: RIDE and CRASH play the synthesised 909's (the hi-hat samples stay) Values: 8-bit (93 KB, 42 dB); 6-bit (70 KB, 30 dB); off. |
| X0X 808 kit (circuit-modelled TR-808) | `DRUM_X0X808` | X0X's TR-808 drum kit (kit UID 38; 16 circuit-modelled sounds) on the 16 lanes; MIDI also plays MT, LC, HC and the claves (note 75). About 30 KB of flash and uses floating point. A build without it plays the synthesised 808 for it and keeps the kit |
| drum ACCENT lane (909 style) | `DRUM_ACCENT` | A 17th step lane on the drum track, the ACCENT lane: no sound of its own, its steps raise every hit of the step by the drum track's ACCENT amount (0 to 127 velocity, default 27: a normal hit plays at full velocity), into each kit's own velocity response (the X0X 909 / 808: their accent input); MIDI out sends the raised velocity. It works as a lane: steps, levels, ratchets, chance and conditions, copy, erase, the STEP tools, patterns, sections, snapshots. Off: the lane is kept and edited but not heard. Needs the automation store (motion, locks, chance or conditions). |

#### Sample sets

| Item | Key | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| PIANO (Steinway, 44 KB) | `SET_PIANO` | A grand piano, plus the dusty and lo-fi piano variants. Played by the SAMPLE and GRAIN engines (and their presets); leaving it out frees its flash, and it can still be uploaded to a USR slot. |
| BASS (39 KB) | `SET_BASS` | An upright bass, plus a deep bass variant. Played by the SAMPLE and GRAIN engines (and their presets); leaving it out frees its flash, and it can still be uploaded to a USR slot. |
| VIBES (33 KB) | `SET_VIBES` | A vibraphone. Played by the SAMPLE and GRAIN engines (and their presets); leaving it out frees its flash, and it can still be uploaded to a USR slot. |
| HORNS (26 KB) | `SET_HORNS` | Horn stabs. Played by the SAMPLE and GRAIN engines (and their presets); leaving it out frees its flash, and it can still be uploaded to a USR slot. |
| STRINGS (20 KB) | `SET_STRGS` | String stabs. Played by the SAMPLE and GRAIN engines (and their presets); leaving it out frees its flash, and it can still be uploaded to a USR slot. |
| FLUTE (31 KB) | `SET_FLUTE` | A lo-fi flute. Played by the SAMPLE and GRAIN engines (and their presets); leaving it out frees its flash, and it can still be uploaded to a USR slot. |
| SCRATCH (23 KB) | `SET_SCRCH` | Turntable scratch hits. Played by the SAMPLE and GRAIN engines (and their presets); leaving it out frees its flash, and it can still be uploaded to a USR slot. |

#### FX: any number (each track its own)

Every track (and the drum bus) can run these at once, each with its own small state sized for every track: only the CPU limits how many run.

| Item | Key | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| DIST (per-track drive) | `FX_DIST` | A distortion on each synth track: low cut, drive from 1x to 8x into an asymmetric soft clip, and a tone filter that closes as the drive rises. About 0.4 KB of flash; off: the DIST controls disappear. |
| SLICER (stutter / gate insert) | `FX_SLICER` | A tempo-synced 16-step gate or stutter on each track (not the sample slicer engine): chops the sound to a pattern. About 1.2 KB of flash and 32 KB of pool at the full capture length. |
| (sub-item) SLICER capture length (stutter memory) | `SL_LEN` | How much sound each track's stutter records to repeat: the shorter capture saves 16 KB of pool and limits how long a repeated chunk can be (the gate mode is unaffected). Values: 186 ms (32 KB pool); 93 ms (16 KB). |
| COMP + LIMIT (master compressor, brickwall limiter) | `MASTER_COMP` | A compressor and a brickwall limiter on the master (GLO > COMP: THRS, RATIO, ATK, REL; GLO > LIMIT: GAIN, CEIL and a GR readout) to glue the mix and keep its peaks under a ceiling; a Comp button and a GR meter in the web mixer. A new project limits at CEIL -3.0 dB (a look-ahead limiter in place of the old one); saved projects keep their own CEIL (OFF: as before). About 2 KB of flash and 2.5 KB of RAM. |
| track FILTER (LP <- off -> HP on each track) | `TRK_FILT` | A DJ-style filter on each track: FX > FILTER (one knob, FILT: left low-pass, right high-pass, centre off) and FX held + KNOB 4 for the selected track. On the drum track it filters the summed drums and all their sends. Saved with the project, kept when the sound changes, recordable with motion. Costs nothing at the centre; engaged, one filter per track (five on the drum bus). |
| FOLD insert (wavefolder) | `INS_FOLD` | A wavefolder type for the tracks' insert slots (INSERTS > S1 / S2: FOLD): the sound driven past full scale folds back, more folds and harmonics as FOLD rises; the drive follows the track's level as DIST's does, the bass stays dry. 0 is off. |
| FUZZ insert | `INS_FUZZ` | A fuzz type for the tracks' insert slots (INSERTS > S1 / S2: FUZZ): a hard-clipped top and a soft, halved bottom (lopsided, buzzy), the drive with FUZZ. 0 is off. |
| PHSR insert (phaser) | `INS_PHASER` | A phaser type for the tracks' insert slots (INSERTS > S1 / S2: PHSR): four all-pass stages swept slowly (~0.5 Hz); PHSR up to the middle mixes it in, past the middle adds feedback. 0 is off. |
| FLNG insert (flanger) | `INS_FLANGER` | A flanger type for any insert slot (a track's, the master's, the USB input's) and the returns (FLNG): a short delay swept 0.25 .. 5 ms (~0.25 Hz); FLNG up to the middle mixes it in, past the middle adds feedback. 0 is off. Each instance is a line in the pool; a track that picks it when every instance is in use stays dry until one is free (the INSERTS list shows how many are left). A saved project keeps the type, not the instance: on load the tracks get them in order T1 T2 T3 DR. |
| FRMT insert (vowel filter) | `INS_FORMANT` | A vowel filter type for the tracks' insert slots (INSERTS > S1 / S2: FRMT): three formant peaks over the sound; FRMT moves the vowel from A (low) through E, I, O to U (high). 0 is off. |
| WIDE insert (stereo width) | `INS_WIDTH` | A stereo width type for the tracks' insert slots (INSERTS > S1 / S2: WIDE): one side through slowly swept all-pass filters, the other dry, so a centred mono track spreads out; WIDE sets how much. 0 is off. |
| SFLD insert (sine wavefolder) | `INS_SFOLD` | A sine wavefolder type (SFLD): like FOLD but the folds are round (a sine of the drive), so it sings and aliases less; soft saturation at first, then more and more folds as SFLD rises. 0 is off. |
| RECT insert (rectifier, octave up) | `INS_RECT` | A rectifier type (RECT): up to the middle the wave's lower half is folded up (half-wave, then full-wave: the octave up of an Octavia), past the middle it is driven into a soft clip. 0 is off. |
| HARM insert (harmonic exciter) | `INS_HARM` | A harmonic exciter type (HARM): adds the octave and the twelfth over each note, warm rather than buzzy, more as HARM rises. 0 is off. |
| RING insert (ring modulator) | `INS_RING` | A ring modulator type (RING): the sound times a sine from 26 Hz (a rough tremolo) to 2.6 kHz (bells, metal), RING picks its pitch. 0 is off. |
| SUB insert (octave down) | `INS_SUBOCT` | An octave-down type (SUB): a square an octave under the note, following its level, added as SUB rises. For single-note lines (bass, leads): chords give a rough sub. Not on drum sounds. 0 is off. |
| SLEW insert (slew-rate crunch) | `INS_SLEW` | A slew limiter type (SLEW): the wave can only move so fast, so edges round into ramps, a slow op-amp's dull crunch; light at 1, heavy (muffled, gritty) at 127. 0 is off. |
| return feedback sends (B to A, C to A, C to B) | `RET_FB` | The master's returns send to the returns on their left too (MASTER > A SENDS, B SENDS, C SENDS: each return to the other two), for feedback between the effects: a delay into a reverb and back. Each such send takes its return's output of the block before (a loop of 32 samples, 0.73 ms), DC-blocked, limited to -12 dBFS and soft-clipped, at a quarter of the gain of a send to the right, so no loop runs away. Without it a return sends only to its right (A to B and C, B to C). About 1.2 KB of RAM; nothing runs while every such send is 0. |
| GATER insert (tempo-synced trance gate) | `INS_GATER` | A rhythmic volume gate type for the tracks' insert slots (INSERTS > S1 / S2: GATER), locked to the tempo and the sequencer's steps (it restarts with PLAY, follows the swing): one of 16 built-in 16-step patterns (trance gates, 1/8 and 1/16 chops, offbeats, dotted, clave), a RATE of 1/8, 1/16, 1/32 or their triplets, DEPTH (the amount: how far a closed step closes, 0 off) and SHAPE (hard to smooth). Every track can run it at once. |

#### FX: limited instances (once, or a set count)

These run once: on the master, or as the one effect each (chorus, delay, reverb: the effects the returns A, B and C hold by default). CHRS and ECHO are insert copies of the chorus and a short delay with a count of instances (each a line in the pool): a track picking one when all are in use stays dry until one is free (fx/insfx/fxi.c).

| Item | Key | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| chorus | `FX_CHORUS` | The chorus effect, fed by each track's CHO send. About 0.4 KB of flash and 4 KB of pool; off: the CHO sends and the chorus settings disappear. |
| delay | `FX_DELAY` | The tempo-synced delay (echo), fed by each track's DLY send. Costs 128 KB of the pool at the full length: shorten it with the length option, or leave it out. |
| (sub-item) delay length (how long an echo can be) | `DLY_LEN` | The longest delay time, which sets the pool memory the delay takes. A time longer than the line is halved until it fits, so it stays on the beat; shorter lines suit fast tempos only. Values: 1.49 s (128 KB pool); 0.74 s (64 KB); 0.37 s (32 KB). |
| (sub-item) delay TIME 1/8D, 1/16D (SLOOP 2.4) | `DLY_DOT` | FX > DLY > TIME gains 1/8D and 1/16D (dotted: 3/4 and 3/8 of a beat), as SLOOP 2.4. With the 0.74 s delay line a 1/8D below 61 BPM halves to 1/16D. Costs 28 B of flash. |
| reverb | `FX_REVERB` | The reverb, fed by each track's REV send and the drums' reverb, with its algorithms below (tick at least one). Each one ticked is on the device's FX > REVERB > TYPE and in the web editor's Reverb popup, switched while it plays; with one ticked there is no TYPE. They share one line buffer, sized to the largest. The biggest user of RAM among the FX (about 17 KB with ROOM); off: the REV sends and reverb settings disappear. |
| (sub-item) reverb: ROOM | `REV_ROOM` | Four delay lines at 44.1 kHz, the reverb as it always was: sparse for its first ~300 ms (separate echoes, a grainy start), then the tail. Its 17 KB of lines set the shared buffer's size when it is ticked. Off, with another algorithm ticked: about 1.8 KB of flash, 2.4 KB of RAM and 2 KB of pool saved. |
| (sub-item) reverb: PLATE (Dattorro) | `REV_PLATE` | Dattorro's figure-of-eight plate at 22.05 kHz: dense from ~50 ms, a smooth decay, nothing above ~11 kHz, about 10 % fewer instructions than ROOM. A 16 KB ring (8 KB at half rate) in the shared buffer. Beside ROOM: about 2.9 KB of flash and 3.4 KB of RAM; with two or more algorithms each one's code runs from main RAM. Experimental: measured on the host and in the emulator only, not yet heard on an FM-1. |
| (sub-item) reverb: FDN8 (long, lush) | `REV_FDN8` | Long and lush: eight slowly modulated lines at 22.05 kHz, dense from ~50 ms, the widest and least ringing tail, nothing above ~11 kHz. Up to SIZE 90 the ROOM's decay; above it the decay doubles every 10 steps to ~14 s at 126 and a near-freeze at 127, the treble kept as DAMP says; about 20 % more instructions than ROOM. A 16 KB ring (8 KB at half rate) in the shared buffer. Beside ROOM: about 4.0 KB of flash and 4.3 KB of RAM (with PLATE too, 1.1 KB of flash and 1.8 KB of RAM are shared). Experimental: measured on the host and in the emulator only, not yet heard on an FM-1. |
| (sub-item) reverb: SPRING | `SPRING` | A spring-tank reverb, one of the reverb's algorithms: the chirp and drip of a guitar amp's spring (SPRNG on FX > REVERB > TYPE when two or more are ticked). Its output is mono, and it is a little lighter on CPU than ROOM (emulator). Beside ROOM: about 1.9 KB of flash and 2.3 KB of RAM; ticked alone it is the only reverb. |
| (sub-item) reverb: VTINY (Airwindows VerbTiny) | `REV_AIRWIN` | Airwindows' VerbTiny (Chris Johnson, MIT): sixteen lines in four 4 x 4 Householder stages, left and right in one loop, at 22.05 kHz. A plain early-digital texture: peakier and grainier than FDN8 (it is not modulated), dense from ~80 ms, ringing no more than the ROOM; nothing above ~11 kHz. SIZE as the ROOM's decay up to 90, then FDN8's long top (~11 s at 126, a near-freeze at 127); DAMP the ROOM's treble loss. Its lines fill the shared 16 KB ring (8 KB at half rate: a smaller room). About 40 % more instructions than FDN8. Beside ROOM: about 4.5 KB of flash and 6.5 KB of main RAM (the tanks' code runs from RAM), no pool past the shared ring (user-default has no flash left for it). Experimental: measured on the host only, not yet heard on an FM-1. |
| (sub-item) reverb buffers in the pool (saves ~17 KB RAM) | `REV_POOL` | Keeps the reverb's shared line buffer (17 KB with ROOM, 8.7 KB at half rate; PLATE and FDN8 without ROOM 16 KB, 8 KB at half rate; SPRING alone 8 KB) in the pool instead of main RAM: main RAM is the scarcer, and the sound and the code stay the same. Needs that much pool free (the undo history shrinks by it in the pool and grows by it in RAM). |
| (sub-item) half-rate reverb (half the RAM, no top octave) | `REV_HALF` | Runs the ROOM reverb at half the sample rate (22.05 kHz) behind a half-band filter: its memory takes half the RAM (-8.7 KB) and it costs less CPU, with the same decay and room size. PLATE and FDN8 already run at 22.05 kHz; here they get half the ring (8 KB), a smaller tank with more audible modes. The reverb loses its top octave (above ~11 kHz); the dry sound and the other buses are untouched. |
| PUNCH (16 punch-in FX) | `FX_PUNCH` | Hold FX and press a white key to put the whole mix through one of 16 effects while it is held (loops, reverse, tape stop, half speed, wobble, echo, filters, crush, gate), beat-synced. About 2.3 KB of flash and 64 KB of pool at the full ring. |
| (sub-item) PUNCH memory length (how much mix it can loop) | `PUNCH_N` | How much of the mix the loop, reverse, tape-stop and echo effects can capture; the shorter ring saves 32 KB of pool and cuts the longest loop in half. Values: 0.74 s (64 KB pool); 0.37 s (32 KB). |
| (sub-item) punch LATCH: FX + key latches its effect | `PUNCH_LATCH` | PUNCH: FX + a key latches its effect so you can let go; the same key or FX + OCT- turns it off, another key switches to its effect, and FX stays lit while one plays. About 80 B of flash. |
| DJ filter (MASTER FILT) | `FX_DJF` | One knob on the master (MASTER > FILT): turn left for a low-pass closing, right for a high-pass opening, centre is off. About 0.7 KB of flash. |
| DUST (vinyl / lo-fi master) | `FX_DUST` | One knob on the master (MASTER > DUST) that runs the mix through an old sampler and a record: drive, lower sample rate, fewer bits, a darker tone, hiss and crackle while playing. About 0.7 KB of flash. |
| DUCK (kick ducks the parts) | `FX_DUCK` | Pumping sidechain effect (MASTER > DUCK): every kick from the drum track dips the synth parts, which swell back over an eighth note. About 0.1 KB of flash; has no effect without a drum kick. |
| CHRS insert (chorus copies for the tracks) | `INS_CHORUS` | A chorus type for the tracks' insert slots (INSERTS > S1 / S2: CHRS), beside the chorus send: two taps around 7 ms swept apart at ~0.8 Hz; CHRS up to the middle mixes it in, past the middle widens the sweep. On the drum track it turns the drums' mid into a stereo chorus. 0 is off. Each instance is a line in the pool; a track that picks it when every instance is in use stays dry until one is free (the INSERTS list shows how many are left). A saved project keeps the type, not the instance: on load the tracks get them in order T1 T2 T3 DR. |
| ECHO insert (short delay copies for the tracks) | `INS_DELAY` | A slapback type for the tracks' insert slots (INSERTS > S1 / S2: ECHO), beside the delay send: one repeat 75 ms after the sound; ECHO up to the middle sets its level, past the middle adds repeats (feedback up to 60 %). Up to 93 ms of line an instance (the long, tempo-synced delay stays the send's). 0 is off. Each instance is a line in the pool; a track that picks it when every instance is in use stays dry until one is free (the INSERTS list shows how many are left). A saved project keeps the type, not the instance: on load the tracks get them in order T1 T2 T3 DR. |
| JUNO CHORUS insert (the Juno-106 chorus) | `INS_JCHORUS` | The Juno-106's chorus as an insert type (INSERTS > S1 / S2, and the master's insert slots: JUNO): the MN3009 BBD model of fm-106, MODE I, II or I+II, JUNO its mix (127: the Juno's chorus on). A mono track comes out stereo. About 130 host instructions a sample an instance. 0 is off. Each instance is a line in the pool; a track that picks it when every instance is in use stays dry until one is free (the INSERTS list shows how many are left). A saved project keeps the type, not the instance: on load the tracks get them in order T1 T2 T3 DR. |
| BASS+ speaker mode | `BASSPLUS` | A third MENU > LOWCUT setting (OFF / LOWCUT / BASS+) for the FM-1's small speaker: it adds harmonics of the bass below ~150 Hz, which the speaker can play, and raises the low cut to ~220 Hz. About 0.5 KB of flash and 0.35 KB of RAM; CPU only while BASS+ is on. |

#### Sequencer

| Item | Key | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| song sections | `SECTIONS` | 8 / 16: banks of 4 (SAVE + OCT), stored compressed in one 32 KiB log with a MEM gauge; the old slots move in at the first start. 4: the slots as before (needed by motion recording) Values: 16: A..P, compressed log; 8: A..H, compressed log; 4: A..D, the old project slots. |
| snapshots (whole-state slots) | `SNAPSHOTS` | SAVE > SNAPSHOT: the working project, every section and the song in one slot, loaded back whole (the state before is kept in BEFORE LOAD); export / import in the web editor. The flash comes from the end of USR3 (slots + 4 sectors of 4 KiB): the user sample slot USR3 holds that much less (docs/SNAPSHOTS.md) Values: 4 slots: 32 KiB, USR3 keeps 32 KiB; 2 slots: 24 KiB, USR3 keeps 40 KiB; 8 slots: 48 KiB, USR3 keeps 16 KiB; off: USR3 64 KiB. |
| per-track patterns and scenes | `PATTERNS` | 16 patterns a track, stored in the section log; a section becomes a scene that names a pattern a track, so scenes share patterns and an unchanged track costs nothing. The old sections become scenes at the first start. LFO held: the PATTERN layer (launch at the end, the next bar or now; store, copy, clear); the web editor shows the slots in the mixer. About 6.1 KB of flash and 0.1 KB of RAM. Off: sections as before (a scene stored with patterns plays as the section it would be). |
| undo / redo history (many levels) | `UNDO_HISTORY` | Undo and redo of pattern edits (EDIT + OCT- / OCT+) over many levels; the history lives in the pool and RAM this build leaves free (at least 1 KiB). About 2.2 KB of flash; off: a single undo level. |
| performance macros (GLO > MACRO) | `MACROS` | COLOR, MOTION, SPACE, ENERGY: four knobs, each moving several sounds' parameters at once (filters and FM index, LFO depths, sends and width, drive and drum level), kept per project and section (the drum track's unused ENV / LFO DEST values: no format change); recorded by motion recording. At home: no change. About 1.4 KB of flash and 0.4 KB of RAM. |
| (sub-item) ENERGY bands thin / thicken the drums | `ENERGY` | ENERGY also thins or thickens the drum pattern in five bands, walked on the beat: core lanes on the eighths, no ghosts, as written, harder hits, hat ratchets and a snare fill every second pass. About 0.6 KB of flash. |
| per-step chance (STEP 2 PROB) | `CHANCE` | Gives each synth step a chance to play (SEQ > STEP 2, KNOB 2: 0 to 100 % in 5 % steps); a step that fails plays as a rest. About 0.5 KB of flash; nothing changes until a step's chance is turned down. Synth tracks only; the web editor does not show it yet. Off: every step plays (chances stay saved). |
| SCL > QNT SEQ (sequenced notes snap) | `QNT_SEQ` | SCL > QNT SEQ: the keys and the sequenced notes snap to the scale as they play, so a pattern follows a change of ROOT or SCALE; the steps keep their notes as written. About 0.3 KB of flash; not on GM KIT or SLICE parts. A build without it plays a project's QNT SEQ as ALL. |
| motion recording (knobs per step) | `MOTION` | Motion recording: while recording, knob turns are stored per step and replayed on every pass (SEQ > MOTION: play on / off per track, clear). The events are the automation store's (up to 128 a track with its locks, nudges and fills); undone with the recording pass, editable from the web editor's protocol (AUTO_GET / AUTO_SET). About 3.4 KB of flash, 0.5 KB of RAM and 1.4 KB of pool (measured before the automation store). |
| (sub-item) mark the parameters motion recording moves | `MOTION_MARK` | With motion recording: a small square in the track colour marks the parameter cards that the track's motion moves (page and VIEW ALL). About 0.3 KB of flash. |
| REC screen dials: mode, length, count-in | `REC_MODES` | REC screen dials: MODE (free / tempo), LENGTH (1 / 2 / 4 bars) and START (note / 4-3-2-1 count-in). The count-in runs on the internal clock only and in 4/4. About 1.2 KB of flash; off: free recording started by a note. |
| SEQ DIV 1/2, 1BAR, 2BAR (SLOOP 2.4) | `DIV_LONG` | SEQ > DIV (and the SEQ layer's KNOB 2) go on past 1/4 to 1/2, 1BAR and 2BAR: a step of 2, 4 or 8 beats, for slow chords and pads; such steps are never swung. Stored values unchanged (appended), so SLOOP 2.4 projects load as they play there. Costs 172 B of flash. |
| micro timing: nudge a step (SLOOP 2.4) | `MICRO` | Micro timing, as SLOOP 2.4: hold a step on the SEQ layer and turn KNOB 4 to play it up to half a step early or late (1/64 of a step a click; the step shows a dot). With it, KNOB 4 on a held step is the nudge and the note length moves to SELECT. Needs SL24_XSTEP (the storage). 2.1 KB of flash with the editor commands. |
| fills: GLO + 9 / 10, step conditions (SLOOP 2.4) | `FILLS` | Fills, as SLOOP 2.4: hold a step on the SEQ layer and press OCT+ to make it play only in a fill (F) or never in one (x); OCT- clears its nudge, locks and fill. GLO + key 9 plays a fill while held, GLO + key 10 makes the next bar one. The FX bypass moves to GLO + black keys 1-4. Needs SL24_XSTEP. 2.5 KB of flash with the editor commands. |
| parameter locks per step (SLOOP 2.4) | `PLOCK` | Parameter locks, as SLOOP 2.4: hold a step on the SEQ layer and turn PRESETS to give it its own value of a sound parameter (the last one you turned, ALGORITHM picks another; the title shows it), up to 128 a track with the motion and the other step events, several a step; it goes back at the next step without one. Beside motion recording: motion plays first, the lock wins on its step. The drum kit locks; the macros' places do not. Needs SL24_XSTEP. 4.4 KB of flash with the editor commands, 0.5 KB of RAM, 0.1 KB of RAM code. |
| step conditions 1:2 .. 4:4 (Felucca 1.5.6) | `COND` | Step conditions from Felucca 1.5.6: a step plays only on loop a of every b of its track (1:2 2:2 1:3 2:3 3:3 1:4 2:4 3:4 4:4), counted from PLAY, a song section or a launched pattern. With FILL and the chance on the same step: the condition, then FILL, then the chance. The Optimist UI: a held step's EXTRA page, COND; SLOOP's UI plays them. A step-only event of the automation store (it builds the store); an older build plays such a step always. About 1.4 KB of flash beside the store's other items (11 KB when it builds the store alone). |
| STEP tools and note generators (Felucca 1.5.6) | `SEQTOOLS` | The sequence tools of Felucca 1.5.6 on STEP's last three pages (the Optimist UI): TOOLS (REVERSE, RANDOM: new notes in the scale or a new beat, COOK: a few small changes, LENGTH x2 / half), each one asking first, and the note generators GEN / GEN OUT (EUCLID, RANDOM, PULSE; REPLACE, ADD or MASK the pattern): played live over the pattern, never written into it but by WRITE, which asks. On a drum lane picked with ALGORITHM, that lane only. Notes keep their exact lengths; locks, chance and conditions move with their steps (the EDIT layer's SHIFT and LENGTH too). About 5.3 KB of flash; nothing with SLOOP's UI. |
| CHORD+ (black keys change the chord), STRUM, VLEAD | `CHORDPLUS` | With a chord mode on (SCL > CHORD), the black keys change the chord played: F# major <-> minor, G# adds the 7th, A# sus4, C# the 9th, D# inverts; hold several to combine, or press one while a chord is held. SCL 2 gains STRUM (1-60 ms a note, right low to high, left high to low; keys and chord steps) and VLEAD (each chord voiced nearest the last). Recorded as it sounds; MIDI out sends the chord unstrummed. |
| quick chain: SAVE + section taps (SLOOP 2.4) | `QCHAIN` | Quick chain, as SLOOP 2.4: while playing, hold SAVE and tap up to 8 sections (of the bank shown: A..P with 16 sections): the first plays from the next bar, and when SAVE is let go they play in that order, each for the bars of its longest pattern, looped; one tap is a plain jump and stops the chain, STOP ends it. RAM only. 1 KB of flash. |

#### MIDI & USB

| Item | Key | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| USB port | `USB_MODE` | What the USB port offers. USB MIDI (notes, clock, the editor and updates) is in every choice. MIDI only (default): nothing more (smallest). CDC console: a read-only serial console for diagnostics. USB audio + MIDI (EXPERIMENTAL): 4 stems in + stereo out (UAC1) next to USB MIDI; the stems are resampled to the computer's clock (cubic, after X0X 80b7d40), so a host passing the input live to an output does not drop out. It replaces the console and needs +12 KB pool (a resampler in the audio path is CPU-heavy). It streams on the FM-1 since 2026-10-12 (before, a USB audio build hung and went to the USB rescue); its audio quality is not checked yet. Values: MIDI only; CDC serial console; USB audio + MIDI, resampled (EXPERIMENTAL). |
| TRS MIDI IN | `UART` | MIDI input on the TRS jack (notes and clock from a keyboard or sequencer). About 0.6 KB of flash; off: the jack hears nothing, and SYNC TRS has no clock. |
| MIDI clock in + out | `MIDI_CLOCK` | MIDI clock both ways. In: follow an external MIDI clock and start / stop (GLO > SYSTEM SYNC: AUTO takes the TRS jack, else USB, else the internal tempo). Out: send MIDI clock on USB so a computer, drum machine or sequencer can follow the FM-1: 24 ticks a beat (also while stopped, so the other side has the tempo first), Start, Stop, and Song Position + Continue when the FM-1 itself continues an external song. Each tick leaves with the sound of its beat (latency-compensated, no jitter of its own), follows tempo changes and the nudge, and never swings. Switched on in the HOME menu (CLOCK OUT, off by default). While the FM-1 follows a USB clock nothing is sent back to USB; following the TRS jack, the clock is passed on to USB. The TRS jack is input only (no MIDI out on the FM-1's board). Off: the FM-1 always runs on its own tempo and sends no clock. |
| MIDI note out of the sequencer (GLOBAL MIDI OUT = BOTH or SEQ) | `MIDI_NOTEOUT` | MIDI OUT = BOTH (SLOOP 2.4's SEQ: the keys and the sequencer) or SEQ (the sequencer alone, no keys): what the sequencer, the arp and the rolls play also goes to MIDI out, each track on its channel, every note ended (STOP, a channel changed, back to KEYS). Switched on GLOBAL's MIDI page (MIDI OUT KEYS / BOTH / SEQ). About 1.2 to 2.5 KB of flash, by build; off: the line goes and only the panel's keys go out. |
| MIDI expression (bend, mod, sustain, RPN) | `MIDI_EXPR` | Plays more than notes from MIDI: pitch bend, mod wheel, breath, foot, aftertouch, sustain pedal and pitch-bend range (RPN 0). About 0.5 KB of flash; off: only notes and the panic messages work. |
| Bluetooth LE MIDI, our own stack | `BLE` | BLE MIDI as the stock firmware offers it (named Optimist XXXX, the BLE-MIDI service), from a stack written for Optimist (docs/BLE-STACK.md): BLE in plays the synth, the FM-1's own notes go out with real timestamps. Tested on an FM-1 with macOS Audio MIDI Setup (not yet with iOS or Windows). The radio's start-up tables, captured from the stock V15 firmware, are included: no V15 file is needed (FM1_STOCK_FWSC makes a fresh capture instead, with the same result). Bluetooth starts OFF: switch it on in HOME > MENU > BLUETOOTH. MIDI IN must be NOTES for notes to play (HOME menu SYSTEM). About 30 KB of flash and 6 KB of RAM (the menu shows the measured figures; BLE_DIAG below adds more); where the build then overflows, ticking it removes the smallest single item that frees enough (sample sets first, then other items), or the one you pick instead. |
| (sub-item) BLE diagnostics: the console's blell, counters and rings | `BLE_DIAG` | For finding BLE faults: the console's blell command (needs a CDC / console build, USB_MODE 1) and the counters and rings behind it (link-layer events, the radio's receive and transmit state, the protocol packets, BLE-MIDI in). About 6 KB of flash and 2.3 KB of RAM, and 6 KB of flash more with the console (USB_MODE 1) for blell itself. Leave it off for normal use: BLE works the same without it; bletrim and blevm stay, and so does the boot breadcrumb. |
| (sub-item) BLE bonding: pairing (Just Works) and an encrypted link | `BLE_BOND` | LE legacy pairing with Just Works (no passkey, as the FM-1 has no screen keypad for it) and bonding, so a Mac or phone that pairs once gets an encrypted link and finds the FM-1 bonded after a power-off. The FM-1 hands out its identity and takes the other side's (its IRK and identity address, kept until power-off for now), which reconnecting to devices with private addresses needs later. Pairing happens only when the other side asks for it. Not yet tested on an FM-1. About 6.7 KB of flash and 0.7 KB of RAM. |
| (sub-item) BLE devices: connect to BLE-MIDI devices, reconnect the last one | `BLE_CENTRAL` | HOME > MENU > BLUETOOTH > DEVICES lists the BLE-MIDI devices nearby (keyboards, controllers, a Mac or an iPhone app that advertises BLE MIDI, another FM-1) with their names and relative signal bars, scanning only while the list is open (the FM-1 stops advertising meanwhile). Picking one connects to it as a central (pairing with Just Works when it asks, as Apple's devices do), MIDI both ways; it becomes the last device, which the FM-1 reconnects to by itself while Bluetooth is on. Brings the bonding of BLE_BOND with it. Without this item DEVICES shows NONE and the last device only. Not yet tested on an FM-1. |
| Bluetooth Classic inquiry probe (console btclk / btinq) | `BT_INQ_PROBE` | Stage 1 of our own Bluetooth Classic stack (docs/BT-CLASSIC-HW-FACTS.md section 14), for testing on an FM-1 from the CDC console (needs USB_MODE 1, and BLE off: one engine on the radio at a time). At start-up it starts the radio with the stored calibration (stock V15's VM; none: nothing is started) and checks the Bluetooth clock and its interrupts for 3 s, transmitting nothing (console btclk). btinq [SECONDS] then runs an inquiry (10.24 s by default): the FM-1 sends inquiry IDs and prints every device that answers (its address, class, clock, signal and EIR name) and a status line a second; btscan [SECONDS] is the other side (an inquiry scan: a phone or computer searching finds OPTIMIST BT); both take options for the hardware's unknowns (entries, RX gain, window, frequency, carrier offset) and bttrace / btrx print their interrupts and receptions. btpage ADDR pages a device as the master and sets the link up with a minimal LMP (features, version, host connection, setup complete; a Raspberry Pi accepted it as a connection): no profile, no audio yet. About 26 KB of flash (most of it the radio's start-up program, which BLE carries too), 1.8 KB of RAM and 13 KB of pool. |

#### UI

| Item | Key | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| user interface: SLOOP's pages or the Optimist rows | `UI` | Which user interface the firmware is built with (docs/UI-OPTIMIST-DESIGN.md). SLOOP's (the default): pages opened by the buttons, the layers held. The Optimist UI, phase 1 of its design: every screen a list of rows, the cursor row's four values on the knobs; HOME is the mixer (SELECT the row, the knobs the four tracks), SOUND the track's pages as rows, PROJECT and SYSTEM; SAVE = YES, HOME = NO, one confirm for what destroys. Not built yet in it: STEP, SONG, the held layers (only PLAY and REC), the Felucca look. Its own code replaces SLOOP's UI code, so it is smaller (the measured sizes: docs/UI-OPTIMIST-DESIGN.md section 11). |
| parameter icons | `ICONS` | A small 12 x 12 icon beside each parameter label. About 5.4 KB of flash; off: no icons, and the labels get their full width back. |
| VIEW ALL overview (4 x 4 PAGEs) | `OVERVIEW` | GLO > SYSTEM VIEW ALL: shows a whole page family at once, 4 rows x 4 knobs a PAGE, PAGE n/m. About 2.4 KB of flash; off: one page at a time. |
| (sub-item) ARP graph and ARP in VIEW ALL | `OV_ARP` | Shows the arpeggiator's graph and puts the ARP settings into VIEW ALL. About 0.6 KB of flash; off: the ARP graph and its VIEW ALL rows are not built. |
| say what a project uses and this build lacks | `MISSING_WARN` | 'MISSING: PHYS T2, KIT 909' in the top bar when a project, song section, user preset or kit uses an engine, kit, sample set or FX this build leaves out (once per item until power-off; never stalls the audio); SAVE > TOOLS > MISS lists them again. Off: they play their stand-ins silently (saves 1.5 KB of flash) |
| favorites: mark sounds, browse only them | `FAVORITES` | SAVE > PRESETS (SLOOP's UI): KNOB 3 FAV marks the selected track's sound as a favorite (ON / OFF), KNOB 4 LIST shows ALL or only the favorites (the PRESETS knob and KNOB 1 then walk just those); a marked sound shows a star in the list. The Optimist UI: with the presets: SHIFT2 (OCT+ held) + PRESETS marks the sound playing, SHIFT2 + SELECT browses only the favorites, a star after a favorite's name in the toast and in PROJECT > USER (SHIFT2 + ITEM marks a slot). Up to 64 factory sounds (kept by engine and name: they stay marked over builds that leave engines out) and any of the 32 user presets (an erased preset loses its mark); the FM6 / CZ banks and the drum track have none. Kept with the settings (136 B at the end of the settings record: an older record reads whole with none; a build without this item keeps the rest and forgets them on its next save). About 1 KB of flash, 136 B of pool. Off: PRESETS KNOB 3 and 4 stay empty. |
| pages as lines (GLOBAL's look), not 2x2 cards + list | `PAGE_LINES` | The Optimist UI (UI=1): a screen of rows with no picture (EDIT, VOICE, PROJECT, SONG, the master FX, SOUND's pages without a graph) shows its cursor row as four lines, as GLOBAL and SYSTEM do: the value's name, the value large on the right, its bar across the screen; KNOB k is line k, SELECT the next row (the header names it and its n/N). Screens with a picture (ENV, LFO, ARP, the FX needles, TEMPO, SCOPE) keep the 2x2 cards over it, the mixer its 1x4 cards. Off: the 2x2 cards with the row list under them, as before. No data change. |
| SYSTEM's debug pages (internals, USB stats) | `SYS_DEBUG` | The Optimist UI (UI=1): SYSTEM keeps its pages for finding faults: INTERNALS (the last reset, the flash's interrupts-off time, the second core's internals), USB STATS (the USB audio glitch counters) and on INFO the clock, the second core, the drops and the CPU guard apart. Off: INFO shows what a player wants, CPU LOAD, UNDERRUNS (the drop-outs counted in) and BATTERY, in the large face, and the code of the rest is left out (about 2.9 KB less flash, measured on a UI=1 USB-audio build). The red / amber mark on the header's rule after a drop-out stays either way. |
| help line: what the knob changes, in words | `PARAM_HELP` | while a knob turns, the top bar (the live screens' header) names its value in plain words, e.g. 'Filter cutoff', 'Reverb send', until ~1 s after the last detent; only the lines of the features built (tools/param_help.json, also the web editor's tooltips). The Optimist UI (UI=1): the screen's last line, while a value turns and ~2 s after, and always on GLOBAL, SYSTEM and PROJECT (the cursor line, the hot action, '(asks)' where it asks first). About 5.5 KB of flash (UI=1: 7.7 KB, its own lines too; the texts packed), no RAM code |
| chord names on the STEP page | `CHORD_NAMES` | SEQ > STEP shows a step of several notes by its chord in any inversion: C, Am, Bdim, Caug, Dsus2, Dsus4, E5, G7, Fmaj7, F#m7, Bm7b5. Other note sets stay a note and the count ('C4 +2'). About 0.3 KB of flash; off: the step's first note and the count. |
| drum steps on the keys (SLOOP 2.4 'Drums with the keys') | `DRUM_STEP` | On the DRUMS grid page (SEQ tapped on the drum track) the 16 white keys are the 16 steps of the sound KNOB 1 picks: press to set a step (you hear the sound), again to clear it; the first four black keys pick the page of steps. You hear what you pick: the sound when KNOB 1 changes it (on the grid and in the SEQ layer), the step's sounds when KNOB 2 moves to it. SELECT switches grid and kit (it is the tempo there without this item). Extra: while playing, the page follows the playhead (black key 5 turns it on / off). SEQ + a white key picks the sound (the SEQ layer's keys are its sounds). With the automation store built (PLOCK, MICRO, FILLS, CHANCE, MOTION), a step key held past the HOLD time is a held step as in the SEQ layer of the synth tracks: KNOB 4 nudge, PRESETS lock value, ALGORITHM lock parameter, KNOB 2 chance, OCT+ fill, OCT- clear (all of it). No data change. About 1.4 KB of flash, 16 B of RAM; the audition runs in the audio interrupt (no fast RAM code). Off: the keys play the pads on the grid page, as before. |
| knob acceleration by turn speed | `KNOB_ACCEL` | 1 / 2 / 3 / 5 / 8 steps a detent when turned fast; never on lists (engines, kits, presets) |
| screen data speed (SPI clock) | `LCD_BAUD` | How fast data is sent to the display: 60 MHz / (n + 1). Faster redraws finish sooner (less tearing); the ST7789V takes ~62 MHz, so 60 MHz is the limit. No flash cost; the faster settings are untested here on hardware. Values: 30 MHz; 12 MHz (as before X0X); 60 MHz. |
| screen: send only the changed rectangle | `LCD_DIRTY` | Redraws only the part of the graph strip that changed instead of the whole strip: less data per frame and less tearing (with the 30 MHz screen clock). Costs about 1.5 KB of flash and 0.6 KB of RAM. |
| key scan by DMA (SPI2) instead of bit-banging | `KEYS_DMA` | The keys' and LEDs' shift register gets its column word from SPI2's DMA instead of 16 bit-banged clock edges in the 10 kHz scan interrupt: a shorter interrupt (less time in which the audio can be held off). After M-VAVE's official FM1 Open V13 firmware. Off until checked on an FM-1. |
| keys light the notes played | `KEYLIT` | Lights the keys of the notes the selected track plays (its steps, the arpeggiator, held notes), so you see the pattern on the keyboard. About 0.2 KB of flash, LEDs only; with LIGHTS, MENU > NOTES turns it on and off at run time. |
| screen brightness (MENU > BRIGHT) | `BRIGHT` | MENU > BRIGHT: the screen backlight in 8 levels, 4/16 at the lowest (software PWM). The level lasts until power-off: every boot starts at full and a dim level is never saved. About 36 B of flash; X0X reports it working on a real FM-1. Off: always full brightness.
| menu LIGHTS / KEYS / NOTES (play in the dark) | `LIGHTS` | Lights for playing in the dark: MENU LIGHTS (every button glows OFF / LOW / MID / HIGH), KEYS (C or white keys glow) and NOTES (the note lights of KEYLIT on / off at run time). About 1.2 KB of flash. |
| BPM LOCK: SELECT is the tempo only with GLO | `BPM_LOCK` | SELECT changes the tempo only while GLO is held, so the tempo cannot slip live; GLO > GLOBAL's BPM knob and tap tempo still work. No menu item: the build switch is the choice. About 64 B of flash. |
| divisions in length order (1/8 8T 1/16 ...) | `DIV_ORDER` | Lists note divisions in length order (1/4 1/8 8T 1/16 16T 1/32) on ARP RATE, SEQ DIV, DELAY TIME and SLICER RATE; stored values are unchanged. About 0.2 KB of flash. |

#### System

| Item | Key | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| web editor (USB SysEx) | `EDITOR` | The web editor's side of the device: editing, presets, samples, backup / restore, snapshots. Firmware updates (the installer, M-UPGRADE) and the USB rescue are not part of it: every build has them. |
| backup / restore from the web editor | `BACKUP` | everything in flash to one .optimist-backup file and back (editor cmds 43..48); a restore onto another build reports what it skips and what plays a stand-in |
| web editor: live editing (else backup / restore only) | `ED_LIVE` | The web editor edits the FM-1 live: the sounds' values, presets, user presets, tracks, steps, the mixer, kits and the ED_* pages, kept in sync both ways. Off: the editor's side is backup and restore only (the frames, INFO, BUILD, the user sample slots a restore writes, the snapshots, cmds 43..48: editor/ed_lite.c); the web page then shows its Backup alone. The ED_* items do nothing without it. |
| web editor: every effect slot and its parameters (cmd 94) | `ED_FXP` | the web editor's FX slots by owner (track inserts, the drum bus and lane inserts, master inserts, returns, the USB input): type list, each type's own parameters (cmd 94 FXP, INFO tag 0x57). Off: the editor's Inserts / Returns pop-ups and the FX slot pages are not offered (the older FX command, 86, keeps its three send effects). About 5.3 KB of flash (measured with the Optimist UI). The INFO tag is sent only when it is built, and the editor hides what it does not find. |
| web editor: drum lanes' mix, LFOs and mutes (cmd 95) | `ED_DLAN` | the web editor's drum lane pan / mute / solo / sequencer mute, the lane's own LFO and the tracks' sequencer mutes (cmd 95 DLAN, INFO tag 0x58). Off: the lane pop-up keeps its older knobs; no lane LFO, mute or solo from the editor. About 1.6 KB of flash (measured with the Optimist UI). The INFO tag is sent only when it is built, and the editor hides what it does not find. |
| web editor: GLOBAL and SYSTEM settings (cmd 96) | `ED_SCRN` | the web editor's Device settings: GLOBAL and SYSTEM as the Optimist UI's lines, with their help (cmd 96 SCRN, INFO tag 0x59). Needs the Optimist UI (UI=1: with SLOOP's UI nothing is built). Off: the editor's Device-lines settings are hidden. About 1.3 KB of flash (measured with the Optimist UI). The INFO tag is sent only when it is built, and the editor hides what it does not find. |
| web editor: the song chain (cmd 97) | `ED_SONG` | the web editor's song chain: PART 1..64 (scene, bars), INSERT / DELETE, LOOP / SONG, SAVE (cmd 97 SONGC, INFO tag 0x5A). Off: the editor's song chain editor is hidden. About 0.7 KB of flash (measured with the Optimist UI). The INFO tag is sent only when it is built, and the editor hides what it does not find. |
| web editor: pattern tools and EUCLID (cmd 98) | `ED_TOOLS` | the web editor's pattern tools REVERSE, RANDOM, COOK, LENGTH x2 / 1/2 and EUCLID, run by the device's own function (cmd 98 TOOLS, INFO tag 0x5B). Needs the Optimist UI and SEQTOOLS. Off: the editor's tools buttons are hidden. About 0.8 KB of flash (measured with the Optimist UI). The INFO tag is sent only when it is built, and the editor hides what it does not find. |
| web editor: the Optimist UI's screens as rows of cards (cmd 99) | `ED_SCRS` | the web editor's Device screens tab: SOUND, MIX, MASTER, PROJECT, STEPS, SONG and TEMPO pages as the device shows them, any track, lane or FM6 operator (cmd 99 SCRS, INFO tag 0x5C). Needs the Optimist UI (UI=1). Off: no Device screens tab; the editor keeps its own Sound / Mixer / Sequence tabs. About 2.8 KB of flash (measured with the Optimist UI). The INFO tag is sent only when it is built, and the editor hides what it does not find. |
| web editor: favorites (cmd 100) | `ED_FAVS` | the web editor's stars in Load preset and its favorites-only list (cmd 100 FAVS, INFO tag 0x5D). Needs the favorites (FAVORITES). Off: no stars in the editor. About 1.0 KB of flash (measured with the Optimist UI). The INFO tag is sent only when it is built, and the editor hides what it does not find. |
| web editor: the oscilloscope (cmd 101) | `ED_SCOPE` | the web editor's Device screens > SCOPE: the device's own trace of the master or a track (cmd 101 SCOPE, INFO tag 0x5E). Needs the Optimist UI (UI=1). Off: no scope in the editor. About 0.6 KB of flash (measured with the Optimist UI). The INFO tag is sent only when it is built, and the editor hides what it does not find. |
| web editor: undo and redo (cmd 102) | `ED_UNDO` | the web editor's UNDO and REDO of the patterns through the device's own undo history (cmd 102 UNDO, INFO tag 0x5F); with it built the editor's own step, lock, nudge, fill and chance writes are undo levels, as a panel step key's are (writes to one track within 800 ms are one level). Off: no undo in the editor. The INFO tag is sent only when it is built, and the editor hides what it does not find. |
| web editor: play notes from the editor (cmd 103) | `ED_NOTE` | the web editor's keyboard: a note on / off for a track through the device's own note input (the arp, the chord layout, the voice budget, REC and MIDI OUT KEYS apply), a ring to the audio interrupt of its own, at most 8 notes held, and an automatic note off after 3 s without a request from the host, on a USB reset, or after a given length (cmd 103 NOTE, INFO tag 0x60). Off: the editor cannot play notes. The INFO tag is sent only when it is built, and the editor hides what it does not find. |
| web editor: track and lane solo and mute (cmd 104) | `ED_SOLO` | the web editor's track and drum-lane SOLO and MUTE through the device's own masks (cmd 104 SOLO, INFO tag 0x61): the same state GLO + key 1..8 and the lane rows set. Off: the strip's SOLO stays a label. The INFO tag is sent only when it is built, and the editor hides what it does not find. |
| web editor: a step in a drum lane, its lockable values (cmd 105) | `ED_STEPLANE` | the web editor's held step in a track and drum-lane context: level, ratchet, chance, condition, nudge, fill, and the device's own list of lockable values (the Optimist UI's lock pages, a drum lane's TUNE .. LEVEL) with the locks and hold events on the step (cmd 105 STEPLANE, INFO tag 0x62). Needs the automation store. Off: the editor lists raw parameter ids and has no lane context. The INFO tag is sent only when it is built, and the editor hides what it does not find. |
| web editor: the REC key and its state (cmd 107) | `ED_REC` | the web editor's REC button in the transport bar: the device's own REC key (arm, start recording, stop, close a free take) and its state: recording, waiting for the start, count-in, free take (cmd 107 REC, INFO tag 0x63). Off: the editor has no REC button. The INFO tag is sent only when it is built, and the editor hides what it does not find. |
| sound tables and FM6 buffers in the pool, not main RAM | `TAB_IN_POOL` | Moves what the sound loops read from main RAM to the pool: the sine, soft-clip and GRAIN window tables (about 2.5 KB, copied there from flash at start-up) and FM6's sine table, operator buses and voices (about 5.9 KB), so builder items get that much more main RAM. Unverified on hardware: both are the same SRAM as far as is known and the emulator cannot tell a speed difference, so on the FM-1 it may be slower; compare the console's TABBENCH figures and the CPU meter with it off and on. The sound is the same. |
| predictive CPU guard (ease back before shedding) | `CPU_GUARD` | Avoids audio dropouts under heavy load by easing quality back step by step before cutting notes. Under overload (the measured load or the one predicted from the voices sounding, over 85 % for 8 halves, or a late half): first ACID without oversampling and ANALOG 2's swarm at 2 copies, then UNISON at 2 voices, then voices shed, never the bass or the lead (MONO / LEGATO / UNISON parts) nor the drums; back after 2 s under 80 % counting what each step saved. The CPU meter shows %G1..%G3. Weights: tools/builder/cpu_costs.py from tests/cpu_baseline.txt (docs/CPU-GUARD.md) |
| more memory from the data cache (for the undo history) | `CACHE_RAM` | Uses 2, 4 or 7 of the 8 data-cache ways (4 KB each) as RAM; 7 is what M-VAVE's own FM-1 firmware and the AC79 SDK's flash-only builds do; the instruction cache (the flash's code and constants) keeps all its ways. The memory is tested at start-up; when the test passes it becomes the undo history's second part (28 KB instead of what main RAM has left), else everything is put back as it was and nothing uses it. It costs about 0.4 KB of flash and 0.1 KB of fast RAM code. Off until checked on an FM-1: whether the flash's data reads use the data cache (then the sound's tables in flash could cost CPU) is not known; the console's tabbench (flash 16K) and boot lines show it. |
| hand-written assembly speed-ups (FM6, ANALOG 2) | `ASM` | The hottest loops of FM6 and ANALOG 2 written in the processor's assembly: the same sound, about 8 to 19 % less audio CPU (emulator), for about 0.6 KB of flash and 0.7 KB of fast RAM code. Keep on; off only to compare with the plain C. |
| SLOOP's data kept safe (never erased) | `SL24_SAFE` | Coming from SLOOP (2.7): Optimist never erases or writes over what SLOOP left that it cannot read: the four section slots and the autosave (shown as SLOOP on the PROJECT page and in the editor, not EMPTY), SLOOP's FM6 bank and a user sample longer than ours (USR3, USR4); SLOOP's user presets are read right, and one Optimist saves into SLOOP's bank leaves SLOOP's presets there byte for byte. SLOOP's settings (its SYN1..SYN4 drum kits, MIDI LEARN, theme and favourites) are never read as Optimist's and never written over: Optimist keeps its own beside them, so each firmware finds its own after a switch. Off, the first start erases SLOOP's projects. About 0.7 KB of flash. |
| step extras storage (nudge, locks, fills; 2.4) | `SL24_XSTEP` | Keeps SLOOP 2.4's per-step extras with every project: each step's nudge (micro timing), its parameter locks and fill condition (the automation store's step-only events, up to 128 a track), stored in 2.4's own layout while it holds them (24 locks a track), so 2.4 projects carry them over. Storage only: the sequencer features that play them come with their own switches. A section with none costs nothing. About 1.6 KB of flash, 0.9 KB of RAM and 4.2 KB of pool. |
| export a project for SLOOP 2.7 (web editor) | `SL24_EXPORT` | Adds Export for SLOOP 2.7 to the web editor's Projects screen: the working project as a SLOOP song file, which SLOOP's editor loads (Song & sections > Load a song file: it replaces the song on that FM-1, never its settings). Nothing is written to the FM-1. The drum lanes go onto SLOOP's sounds with their TUNE and DECAY, held notes stay held. Lossy, and the editor lists what is left out: FX OFF, ANALOG 2, SLICE / ACID / CZ parts (their fallback), an FM6 voice that is not one of SLOOP's F1..F8 (F1), X0X and user kits (808), drum lanes on user samples or sending apart, the reverb type, COMP / LIMIT, the steps' chance, motion, locks on those; sections and samples stay behind. About 1.5 KB of flash (unmeasured since 2026-10-19). |
| import SLOOP 2.7 projects (LOAD twice) | `SL24_IMPORT` | A SLOOP 2.7 project left in a section slot shows as SLOOP on the PROJECT page; LOAD it twice and it becomes the working project (values, engines, drum kits, steps; nudges, locks and fills with the step extras storage), then SAVE puts it in a section; PROJECT > SLOOP IMPORT (twice) does the same with SLOOP's autosave. The original stays in flash. The drums: each of SLOOP's 16 sounds with hits gets a lane playing it (on its default lane when it has one), with its TUNE and DECAY; more than 10 used: the 10 with the most hits (said DRUMS CUT). Held notes stay held. An FM6 part keeps its factory patch as its voice, with SLOOP's macros in it; a USR1..USR3 kit plays the same user sample slot from the lanes. Lost: the INSERT, ENV SYNC, LFO 2's TRIG / POL, GLO > TEXTURE, a NOISE part (ANALOG), a SYN kit (the default kit), the arp modes past ORD (the nearest, said ARP CUT); the ANALOG filter TYPE goes to ANALOG 2's, LFO 2's SYNC to the LFO's tempo-synced RATE. About 3.5 KB of flash (unmeasured since 2026-10-19). |
| import a SLOOP 2.7 song or backup (web editor) | `SL24_EDIMPORT` | Adds Import a SLOOP 2.7 song or backup to the web editor's Projects screen: a project of a SLOOP song file or backup file (its loop, or A..D of a backup) becomes the working project, as LOAD twice does with one left in flash; SAVE then keeps it in a section. Nothing else is written. Needs SL24_IMPORT. About 1.2 KB of flash and 0.4 KB of pool. |
| SELECT turns the pages of a family (SLOOP 2.4) | `SEL_PAGES` | Turning SELECT on a parameter page (ENV, LFO, FX, EDIT, ARP, SEQ, SCL, GLO, SAVE) goes to the previous or next page of that group, as SLOOP 2.4 and as tapping the group's button again, but both ways and stopping at the ends. On TRACKS, the SONG and DRUM screens, the REC screen and while a layer is held, SELECT stays the tempo. Off: SELECT is always the tempo. Flash only (about 0.2 KB, unmeasured). |
| full-screen visualiser, 12 styles (SLOOP 2.4) | `VIS` | The full-screen visualiser of SLOOP 2.4: on the TRACKS screen tap HOME and the screen shows the sound (oscilloscope, spectrum, spectrogram, Lissajous, VU meters, circle, tape, LCD, bounce, orbit, wires, the SLOOP logo); SELECT changes the style, HOME again closes it. The keys, PLAY, REC and the layers work as ever. It shows the sound as if MASTER were all the way up. Each audio block is copied once for it (no work per sample). Costs about 9.1 KB of flash, 12.2 KB of RAM (8 KB of it the copy of the sound) and 5.5 KB of pool. |
| big values on pages without a graph (SLOOP 2.4) | `BIGVALS` | Pages without a graph (EDIT, VOICE, the DEST pages, GLOBAL, MASTER, SYSTEM...) use the empty middle of the screen: their four values in large type, placed as the knobs are (KNOB 1 2 above, KNOB 3 4 below), the one you turn in white; a page with one value shows it across the middle. As SLOOP 2.4. Costs 608 B of flash and 112 B of RAM. |
| second CPU core renders parts 2-3 | `DUAL` | The FM-1's second CPU core renders synth parts 2 and 3 while the first renders the rest, cutting the first core's load by 40 to 44 % in the emulator, with the same sound. It costs about 1.8 KB of flash, 1.9 KB of RAM and 6 KB of pool. On some FM-1s the second core misreads RAM at the boot loader's supply: it then runs nothing it misread, is held for the session and the FM-1 goes on with one core (the message CPU1 OFF MISREAD); a boot after one that crashed in its first 30 s stays on one core. |
| (sub-item) raise the core rails to the FM-1's stock values at start-up (for the second core) | `STOCK_SUPPLY` | At start-up, before the second core, the audio and Bluetooth, the FM-1's rails are set as its own M-VAVE firmware sets them: the 1.4 V rail moved from its LDO to the DC-DC, then raised to 1.60 V (VDC14 7), then the core rail to 1.38 V (SYSVDD 15), a step at a time, never lowered (the boot loader leaves 1.40 V and 1.26 V). Read back after: if a value is wrong, the second core stays off (2ND CORE OFF SUPPLY) and the FM-1 runs on one core. SYSTEM > INTERNALS shows the rails (SUPPLY). Second-core builds only; it replaces the earlier DUAL_BOOST (1.50 V / 1.38 V on the LDO). On the second core's test unit both cores crashed within seconds at the boot loader's rails and ran 3 x 3 minutes with 1.50 V / 1.38 V; the stock sequence itself is still being measured. |

### Where an item came from

Items ported from another project carry their provenance (project, author, licence, commit) in the registry;
the menu shows it in the details panel. Items from X0X (`charlesvestal/fm1-x0x`, GPL-3.0-only, by Charles
Vestal) show a NOTICE when selected. What X0X uses only by its author's permission (its break player,
`dsp/breaks*`: no licence) is never offered (`registry.FORBIDDEN`; a `.config` naming it is refused).

Performance macros (MACROS, off by default; after Flowstate, GPL-3.0): COLOR, MOTION, SPACE, ENERGY on GLO > MACRO,
applied in the audio ISR over the authored values (firmware/src/core/macro.c has the table), kept in four drum-track values
the drum track never reads (no format change), recorded by motion recording. Its option ENERGY thins / thickens the
drum track's steps in five bands. Off: the build is byte-identical to the one without the code; built in and at home:
the goldens and a 4-track mix render bit-identical (tests/macro_test.c). user-default with MACROS: +1,432 B flash
(+1,996 B with ENERGY), +400 B RAM. A parameter a macro moves shows the value that plays (amber, with an M and a gauge
tick) on the device and in the web editor (editor command 65); that costs +2,336 B flash and +16 B RAM on everything-that-fits
with MACROS, ENERGY and MOTION (RAM code unchanged, 32,424 of 32,512).

Constraints the configuration checks (errors): at least one synth engine, at least one FM6 mode, a drum source.
Motion recording works with every SECTIONS: with 4 its data sits beside the four project slots (as before),
with 8 / 16 each section's record carries it.

### Song sections (SECTIONS)

16 (default) or 8: sections A..P / A..H in banks of 4, stored compressed in one 32 KiB log (the old project
slots' area, firmware/src/storage/sections/sec_log.c), the song layer's title shows the MEM gauge ("mem 34% +12": the share used
and how many more sections of the last size fit). SAVE + OCT- / OCT+ changes the bank; the keys play / store
within it. MEM FULL refuses a new section; room for one record of the longest size is always kept, so the playing
section can always be saved; clearing one always works; an empty section costs nothing. The first start moves the
four old project slots in as A..D (cut anywhere, the next start goes on). 4: the four slots as before.
The reserve is exact: a record never spans two sectors, so a byte count alone can say "room" when sectors each
holding one ~3 KB section have none. sec_log.c models its compaction (where each record is, the sectors' order)
and takes a store that is not the playing section's only when, after it, a record of the longest size would still
go in; the gauge's "+n" counts on the same model. A compaction cut while copying can leave a half-written copy
taking the head's room; the next start then empties whichever sector's live records fit there (not only the
oldest), so the log always gets its spare sector back.
Motion recording (MOTION) with 8 / 16: a section with recorded knob moves carries them in its record, a chunk
after the flags byte (count, the PLAY bits, 3 bytes an event: +2 B +3 B an event, in the gauge like the rest);
none recorded, no chunk. Saved, stored while playing (the arena), written, cut, staged for the song: with its
section, in one record and one CRC. A raw record with motion leaves out the project's magic, size and sum
(rebuilt as it loads), so the longest record, raw with 64 events and a drum record, is 4,059 B (4,076 B with
its head, a 4 KiB sector holds 4,080). Every build reads a chunk (one without MOTION plays the section without
it, and keeps it until the section is saved again) and counts it in its longest record, so no build's log ever
finds another's record too long. The first start of an 8 / 16 build moves each old slot's motion (beside it in
its sector) into its section. With 4 the storage is as it was: the 208 B beside each project and the autosave.
Since 2026-10-15 an 8 / 16 build writes no chunk: the whole automation store (motion, locks, nudges, fills,
chance, conditions) goes in the section's extras record in its new form; the chunk, the MOTN record and the
2.4 stepx form are only read (an older Optimist's sections and autosave load and convert; the first start's move
of an old slot still puts its motion in the chunk).
The song chain: 64 parts with 8 or 16 sections (16 with 4). The settings record keeps its layout, with the first
16 parts, so an older build plays those. The whole chain is a record of the log (id 16), saved before the
settings record, which names it by a tag. A save cut between the two keeps the old chain whole. The backup
object is `SNG1`. The log's ids are the same in every build (0..15 sections, 16..23 songs), so a build with
fewer sections keeps the other sections' records: going from 16 to 8 sections and back loses nothing.
Record sizes (tests/sec_codec_test.c): the power-on project 70 B, a typical 16-step section 478 B (8 a 4 KiB
sector), random ones 1.1 KB on average, the dense worst case 3,877 B (raw). The stage's decode, emulator: 42,606
instructions for a 524 B section (~0.18 ms at 240 MHz at one instruction a cycle).
Data stored in the app slot's unused end does not survive an update: the package pads the app to the slot with
0xFF and the loader writes the whole range (tools/fm1pkg_make.py, firmware/loader), so only the data areas
(the log, the USR slots) can hold sections.

### Snapshots (SNAPSHOTS)

SAVE > SNAPSHOT keeps the whole state (the working project, every section, the song) in a slot and loads it back;
docs/SNAPSHOTS.md has the design. 4 (default), 2 or 8 slots plus BEFORE LOAD (the state before the last load).
The flash comes from the end of USR3: slots + 4 sectors of 4 KiB, any free sector takes any part of a snapshot,
part 0's header is written last (a cut save leaves the old version; a cut clear never brings an older one back).

| SNAPSHOTS | area | USR3 left | typical snapshots (1 sector) that fit | the largest (8 sectors) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 64 KiB | none | - |
| 2 | 24 KiB | 40 KiB | 2 + BEFORE LOAD + 3 spare | does not fit (FULL) |
| 4 | 32 KiB | 32 KiB | 4 + BEFORE LOAD + 3 spare | fits an empty area |
| 8 | 48 KiB | 16 KiB | 8 + BEFORE LOAD + 3 spare | fits beside 4 typical ones |

Measured (tests/snapshots_test.c): the power-on state 203 B, three 16-step sections with a song and the work
2,105 B (one sector), three dense sections 3,980 B; the largest a full section log can make is under 29.3 KB.
Cost (costs.json, measured 2026-10-07 on optimist e42c86c): 8,708 B of app and 336 B of RAM, no pool; the slot
count costs nothing more (2: 16 B, 8: 32 B). No snapshot function is in RAM code; the RAM code still moves by a few
dozen bytes with it, the audio path's code generated differently as the rest of the unity build changes (user-default:
-92 B, mix_block 9,242 -> 9,152; everything-that-fits: +68 B, drums_mix 3,598 -> 3,664, 20 B left).
A build without snapshots has a 64 KiB USR3 again: a long USR3 sample uploaded there overwrites the area (the
backup keeps snapshots: object SNAP); a build with them does not write over such a sample (`USR3 SAMPLE IN THE WAY`
until USR3 is erased or loaded again).

### Backup and restore across builds

The editor's backup holds every stored object (cmds 43..48). BK_LIST tells what the device's build holds (engine,
kit and sample-set masks by UID, slot capacities, the section count and record layout); before a restore the
editor shows a report and asks to confirm: objects not in the build or larger than its slot are skipped whole
(never truncated), and each part whose engine, sample set or kit the build leaves out is named ("section C track 2
uses PHYS: plays ANALOG, settings kept": the orphan path keeps its settings). A section's motion travels in its
record (S01..S16, byte for byte); a build without MOTION (BUILD bit 76) is named in the report ("section B has a
motion recording (10 events): this build has none ..."). With 4 sections the motion sits outside the project's
payload, so a PRJ1..PRJ4 / AUTO backup does not hold it (as before this change).

## How a switch works

- `firmware/src/core/registry.h`: the engines as an X-macro list with their permanent UIDs (FUN7 numbers) and
  fallbacks, and the defaults of every switch. Optimist is one translation unit: an item left out is a constant
  `0` (`ENG_IS()`, `if (FELUCCA_FX_X)`), so its code, tables, RAM and pool go. Pages and cells of a missing FX
  disappear (`params.c` `page_shown`, `cell_built`).
- `tools/builder/configure.py` turns a `.config` into `build/gen/felucca_config.h` (included first by
  `tools/build.py`) and the generators' environment (sample sets, PERC, SLICE's BREAK).
- Stable IDs: projects, user presets and the drum lanes store engine, kit and sample-set UIDs. A part whose
  engine this build leaves out plays the fallback (FM6 -> DIGITAL -> ANALOG, GRAIN -> SAMPLE, the rest ->
  ANALOG) with its defaults, shows `FM6*` on HOME, and keeps the original engine, preset, EDIT values and FM6
  voice: they are written back on save as long as you leave that part's sound alone. A full build then plays
  it as before (`tests/builder_rt_test.c`). A user preset of a missing engine stays in the bank, not loadable.
  A kit not built plays the other source's first kit; a sample set left out keeps its number (empty).
- Telling the user (`MISSING_WARN`, UI, on; firmware/src/storage/miss.c): after a load (a project, a song section, also
  while playing, a user preset or kit) the main loop scans the working project for what this build lacks and says
  it in the top bar, "MISSING: PHYS T2, KIT 909 +2", once per item until power-off. The audio side only bumps a
  counter (proj_apply). SAVE > TOOLS > MISS counts the items and lists them one by one. Names come from the
  tables already built (ENG_UID_NAME, DRUM_KIT_NAMES, SMP_ALL_NAMES; an FX name only when its switch is off).
  Cost (measured): 1,112 B flash on user-default (1,160 B on the default build), 64 B RAM (from the undo
  ring). `tests/missing_test.c` loads a full build's project, section and user kit on a reduced build and keeps
  the screens (build/host/miss).
- The knob's help line (`PARAM_HELP`, UI, off by default; on in everything-that-fits; firmware/src/ui/sloop/param_help.c):
  while a parameter knob turns, the top bar (the live screens' header, the song screen's knob labels) names its
  value in a few plain words ("Filter cutoff", "Reverb send", "Swarm spread (ENV2)"), gone ~1 s after the last
  detent (64 frames; nothing on a page change, a button or the tempo knob). One table, tools/param_help.json
  (320 lines: every page, every engine's EDIT values and mode labels, the drum SOUND pages, the FM6 operator
  editor, TRACKS, the drum grid / kit, SONG, REC), also the web editor's tooltips; tools/gen_param_help.py writes
  build/gen/felucca_param_help.h with each group under its feature's condition, so a build carries the lines of
  what it has. The texts are packed with a byte pair code (one table of up to 159 pairs, 318 B, made from every
  line; the labels and contexts stay plain for the lookup) and unpacked into a line on the stack when drawn
  (firmware/src/ui/ph_blob.c, main loop): -1,840 B on user-default with PARAM_HELP (UI=0, item cost 7,380 -> 5,540 B),
  -2,752 B with UI=1 (10,460 -> 7,708 B), -2,944 B on the author's build (measured 2026-10-13); 0 B RAM (the line's
  offset sits in padding of the UI state), 0 B RAM code. (A shared word dictionary, measured earlier, saved less:
  -1.8 KB for +48 B RAM.) `tests/param_help_ui.c` checks every reachable value has a line that fits (232 px);
  `tests/param_help_pack_test.c` that every line unpacks to the table's text.
- The firmware reports what it is: editor protocol v6, INFO adds each slot's engine UID, `BUILD` (49) the
  configuration's name, hash and one bit per registry item.

## Budget

`tools/builder/measure_costs.py` builds every item at every non-default value (measurement builds link past the
slot) and writes `costs.json`: the default build's sizes, each item's delta, the pairs and the real builds the
estimate is checked against (below); the menu's build gives the exact figure.

**Landing step: `make costs`** (`python3 tools/optimist.py costs`, i.e. `measure_costs.py --missing`) after every
batch that adds a registry or backport item or a pair. It finds each item value `costs.json` has no entry for (a
missing entry shows in the builder as free), each `PAIRS` entry not yet measured, and measures only those, keeping
the rest, the other pairs and the CPU section; it measures the base again, and says so, whenever the default build moved
at all (no tolerance: the estimate is base + deltas and the test holds it to the real build within 256 B, so a base
left stale by a smaller move would eat that margin; the other deltas stay as measured, a full run, without
arguments, refreshes them). A measurement build is ~30 s (Docker), so a typical run is the base build plus one build per new value. A
cost of 0 is a measurement too (an all-zero entry). `--missing --check` builds nothing and exits 1 with that hint when
something lacks: `tests/builder_test.py` runs the same check, and so does the `host-tests` job of
`.github/workflows/build.yml`, so an unmeasured item cannot land. Not detected: an item whose code changed after it
was measured (there is no item-to-source map); re-measure it with `--only KEY`.

The five sampled kits (KIT_*) share the PERC samples: each kit alone costs only its few bytes of code, all five
off together drop the samples. That is the `KIT_*=0` pair; the menu names it on each kit line ("shares PERC samples
(N KB) with the other sampled kits") and shows the real saving on the last ticked kit. An item whose cost depends on another's
value is measured with it too (`PAIRS` in measure_costs.py, `PAIR_WITH` for a pair not valid alone): `costs.json`
"pairs" holds what the build has beyond the estimate without that pair (the items' deltas, the computed terms below
and the earlier pairs it contains, so a three-item entry after its two-item ones is the three-way remainder), which
the estimate adds when the configuration has all of them. Today: MOTION with SECTIONS=4, the reverb's algorithms
together and ROOM off with REV_HALF (the half-band filters are the ROOM's), the CZ banks, the kits, the X0X 909 and
808 together (their voice code and state once: -3.7 KB flash, -1.2 KB RAM), all seven sample sets off and with the
sampled drums off too, and SLOOP 2.4's MICRO / FILLS / PLOCK (shared step-extras code).

**Computed terms (configure.py `model_terms`).** The reverb's shared line buffer (`rev_line`) is the size of the
largest algorithm built, halved by REV_HALF, and REV_POOL moves it from main RAM to the pool (FDN8 then takes twice
the ring): a maximum and a region choice no sum of deltas reproduces. `rev_lines(cfg)` computes it from the same
macros as fx.c and reverb_alt.c, the estimate adds it against the default build's, and every measured delta and
pair leaves it out (the menu shows an item's delta with it, `item_delta_alone`). Before (2026-10-08, the "mots"
configuration: FDN8 alone, REV_POOL and REV_HALF) the per-item sum counted the buffer's saving three times and
under-predicted main RAM by 8,196 B (optimist a1b2366: 89,268 B predicted, 97,464 B real of 98,304).

The automation store (`seq/auto.h`, `auto.c`, `storage/auto_proj.c`) is the second computed term. It is built with
ANY of MOTION, CHANCE, SL24_XSTEP (and MICRO, FILLS, PLOCK, which force SL24_XSTEP: `FELUCCA_AUTO`), so measured one
item at a time each of them paid the whole store (about 2 KB RAM and 8 to 9 KB pool each) and the sum overshot.
`auto_store(cfg)` computes the arrays once, from the same constants as the firmware (`AUTO_MAX` 128 events of 3 B and
4 tracks: `auto_store_t` 1,548 B): main RAM the working store (`auto_w`) and the undo's copy of one list (385 B);
the pool `auto_aux` x 4, `auto_slot` x 4 more with SECTIONS 4, and the extras record's read buffer (`sx_rbuf`). The
measured deltas and pairs leave it out like the reverb buffer. What is not an array is the store's code (about 7 KB of
flash, 51 B RAM, 704 B pool of tables and glue), which each of the three items still carries when measured alone;
the group AUTO (below: any of MOTION, CHANCE, SL24_XSTEP, COND) counts it once. Before
(2026-10-09, "mots", integration30 17ceb7d) the estimate was under the real build by 928 B RAM and 3,412 B pool
(512 B allowed); after it is over by 416 B RAM and 24 B pool.

**Anchored estimate (2026-10-14).** The sum model (base + deltas + pairs + groups + computed terms) is right near
the defaults and drifts the further a configuration is from them: the firmware is one LTO unit compiled for size, so
a feature's helpers, inlining and UI code follow what else is built. On 2026-10-14 it put a user's Optimist-UI
configuration 17.7 KB of flash under its real build (the builder said it fit; it was 7.8-17 KB over) and
user-default 6.6 KB over. So `configure.py budget` now starts from the nearest configuration whose real build is
known (an anchor: the defaults, every check configuration and probe in costs.json, and every real build made from
this source, `build/exact-sizes.json`) and adds what the sum model says the differing items change, plus
`ANCHOR_MARGIN` per differing item (256 B of flash: it errs over; none in RAM, pool and RAM code, whose single-change
errors are 0 at the median). The BLE test builds `optimist.py test` makes are check configurations too
(`optimist.py ble_test_configs`), so their drift is held like the profiles'. The items both share cost
exactly what they cost together. A configuration built once is exact from then on, and a few changes from it are
estimated from it. `budget(..., anchor=False)` is the plain sum (measure_costs.py measures pairs against it). The
root causes found by bisection that day, now in the model:

- engines.c `part_mem`, the synth parts' engine states in the pool, is a union of FM6, PHYS, GRAIN and ACID: GRAIN off
  frees 9.3 KB unless PHYS is on. `configure.py part_mem` computes the largest member built (`PART_MEM`, measured by
  `measure_costs.py --part-mem`; every measurement build checks it against the real symbol, `sizes.json` "symbols").
- Code built with ANY of a set of items is a group (`GROUPS`, read from the firmware's own `#define`s): the insert
  slots (`INS_FX`, 0.96 KB RAM and 1.5 KB flash counted once, not per insert) and the automation store's code
  (`FELUCCA_AUTO`, 9.5 KB of flash: CHANCE off with MOTION, XSTEP and COND still on was 9 KB over as pairs). Each group
  is measured with the Optimist UI too (`NAME|UI=1`).
- The Optimist UI is a second firmware for many items (FM6_KEYS, DRUM_EDIT, PARAM_HELP, ICONS: 0.4 to 5 KB each away
  from their SLOOP-UI deltas): every item value is measured with UI=1 as well (a `UI=1,KEY=V` pair), and every pair.
- Items only built with another: DRUM_ACCENT needs the automation store (core.h `#undef`s it otherwise: parsed,
  `NEEDS_AUTO`), SEQTOOLS needs the Optimist UI (`NEEDS`; it put 5.5 KB of flash into user-default's estimate).
- `project.c sl24_xs` (704 B pool) is built with the store and SLOOP 2.4's import or export; the user sample zones
  (1.3 KB RAM) with any of SAMPLE, GRAIN, SLICE, DRUM_USR (a pair, all four off); SL24_SAFE with SL24_IMPORT,
  CPU_GUARD with ACID and the X0X kits, BLE's bond / central / diagnostics (pairs).

**Checked against real builds.** Every run of measure_costs.py that builds also makes a measurement build of every
profile, of each configuration in `tools/builder/estimate/` (`mots-ui` is a user's own, with the Optimist UI) and of
each one's probe (`NAME~`: 4 items changed, picked by a hash of the names), costs.json "checks"; `--missing --check`
fails when one is not measured. `tests/builder_test.py` then:

1. estimates each of them without its own build (from its probe or the other way round, 4-5 items away): within 6 KB
   of flash, 512 B RAM, 1 KB pool, 768 B RAM code. Measured on optimist f626af77: flash -2.3 to +4.8 KB, RAM
   -16 to +276 B, pool within 708 B. Without the probe either (8-29 items from the nearest other anchor) it prints the
   error and does not fail: -13 to +28 KB of flash for the two users' configurations, which is the sum model alone.
2. **drift**, the check that keeps costs.json honest: `optimist.py test` (prepare_tests) first makes a measurement
   build of every check configuration from the source under test, then user-default, its two BLE builds and the
   defaults. Each estimate (costs.json's anchors only) must be within 1 KB of flash and 256 B elsewhere of today's
   real build. A merge that moves the firmware past that fails the normal test run; `python3 tools/optimist.py costs`
   (measure_costs.py --missing: the base and every check again) fixes it. `--python` and `--no-build` runs have no
   real build to compare and say so.

| Configuration (est - real, flash) | Before (99af919a, plain sum) | After: the estimate the menu shows | After: without its own build (4-5 items away) |
|---|---|---|---|

**Making room for BLE (BLE replaces samples).** BLE costs about 29.6 KB of flash and 6.2 KB of RAM (costs.json, 2026-10-09;
11.6 KB of the flash is the radio's start-up tables, captured at build time); its `BLE_DIAG` option (the console's
`blell`, off by default) adds 5.8 KB of flash and 2.3 KB of RAM, and a console build (`USB_MODE` 1) about 1 KB (BLE's
`bletrim` / `blevm` commands) and 6 KB more (`blell`'s printing). user-default takes BLE as it is; a fuller profile may
not. Where the build would overflow, ticking BLE in the menu removes **the smallest single item that frees enough**, the
sample sets first and then the other items (the FLUTE set, 31 KB, where it alone is enough; a removed set can still be uploaded to a
USR slot), and says so in the message panel: "BLE needs ~30 KB of flash: SCRCH samples removed to make room (23 KB);
pick another to remove instead (untick it): VIBES samples 33 KB, BASS samples 39 KB, ..." (x0x-drums today), with the other sets and big items that alone would free enough and
their sizes (`costs.json`, the same figures as the item lines). An item has to free every region that overflows: where
the RAM overflows too, a sample set does not help and an item that frees both goes instead. Where no single item frees
enough (today drum-machine and everything-that-fits, with or without `BLE_DIAG`), nothing is removed and the message says
"no single item frees enough": remove several by hand, or let `--fit` choose. The rules, in `tools/builder/room.py` (the
menu and the command line share them); `tests/builder_test.py` computes the expected item for every profile, with and
without `BLE_DIAG`, from `costs.json` as it is (nothing pinned) and checks it, so they hold when BLE or a profile
changes size (`tests/builder_menu_test.py` does the same on the menu's panel):

- BLE fits as it is (user-default today): nothing is removed.
- BLE overflows and a single item frees enough: that item goes (FLUTE when it is enough, else the smallest set that is,
  else the smallest other item), it fits, and the message offers the others.
- Another item unticked while one is removed and then the build fits with the first back: the first comes back, the
  pick stays off; a pick too small to make room changes nothing.
- BLE unticked: what was removed comes back, except an item the user ticked or unticked by hand meanwhile.
- Loading a profile or a `.config` forgets what was removed; a `.config` holds the resulting values (SET_PIANO=0 ...),
  nothing else.

Headless: `--ble-drop ITEM` on `optimist.py build|package` and `configure.py` (with `--set BLE=1`; `FLUTE`, `PIANO`, or
any item key) does the same removal and prints the message; it removes nothing when BLE fits as it is, and refuses an
item that frees too little. `optimist.py test` builds its emulator BLE package with `BLE=1 BLE_DIAG=1` (the test reads
the diagnostics block) and `--ble-drop FLUTE`. A build without BLE is unchanged.

**BLE_DIAG.** With it off, the link layer's counters, the event, receive, transmit and protocol rings, the BLE-MIDI
counters and the console's `blell` command are not compiled; `bletrim`, `blevm`, `blevmdump` and the boot breadcrumb
stay, and the radio code is the same (every recording is a statement that disappears). docs/BLE-STACK.md section 12.7.

**Shared DSP blocks and tables (docs/DSP-SHARED.md).** A block several items use (dsp_common.h, dsp.c, dsp_float.h:
xorshift32, soft_knee, tsvf_tick, ima_nibble, lerp16, ...) is `always_inline`: each item that is built compiles its
own inlined copy into its own functions, and an item left out takes its copy with it. So the per-item model needs no
"shared by A or B" term for them: an item's delta is exactly what it adds, and the deltas did not move when the
blocks were merged (2026-10-07: every function of the six measured builds identical). A shared *table* (IMA_STEP
for SAMPLE / GRAIN / SLICE, SVF_G, PITCH_INC_OCT, SINE...) is `static const` in the one unit: the compiler keeps it when
any built item reads it, so it is in the default build's base while any default item uses it, and it is counted in
the delta of an item measured alone only when no default item reads it (e.g. a table only PHYS and CZ read would be
counted in both items' deltas, once too often when both are on: then the item pairs belong in `PAIRS`). No such
table turned up in the inventory (the X0X tables are the 909's alone; ACID and the X0X kits each compile their own copy of dsp_float.h in their own unit); the exact build stays authoritative.

### The profiles (config/profiles/, real links, 2026-10-07: optimist e42c86c + feat/snapshots, SNAPSHOTS 4 in every profile; before it 2026-10-06 with the SLOOP 2.3 fixes on, the large font from the small one, the cheaper X0X kits, X0X voices on lanes and style kits, the editor commands 50..53)

| Profile | Left out to fit | App (of 581,564) | RAM (of 98,304) | Pool (of 335,872) | RAM code (of 32,512) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| user-default | LOFI, VOICE, delay 0.74 s, SCRATCH set, FM6's operators in VIEW ALL | 568,336 | 74,372 | 306,860 | 29,308 |
| fm-va-studio | GRAIN, VOICE, LOFI, PHASE, WHEEL, SCRATCH set | 561,184 | 89,604 | 321,680 | 26,680 |
| drum-machine | FM6, DIGITAL, PHASE, VOICE, TRIO, WHEEL, STRINGS set | 563,288 | 85,688 | 331,028 | 23,712 |
| everything-that-fits | SCRATCH and STRINGS sets, PUNCH ring 0.37 s, changed-rectangle LCD strips (20 B of RAM code left; 88 B without snapshots); with the knob's help line (PARAM_HELP, +6.4 KB) | 567,860 | 77,732 | 327,340 | 32,492 |
| x0x-drums | drum-machine's, plus: the five sampled kits, PIANO, HORNS and FLUTE sets, delay 0.74 s (for the X0X 909 and 808 kits) | 539,976 | 69,776 | 293,484 | 23,868 |

The estimate (`--budget`) was above the real app size by 208 to 708 B for the first four profiles and by 2.5 KB (0.5 %) for x0x-drums. A sample set
left out can still be uploaded to a USR slot.

## Verification

`tools/builder/verify.py [--random N] [--emu]`: every profile and N random configurations (fitted by the
estimate) build, link and fit; no symbol of an item left out stays in the ELF; `tests/regress.c` built with the
configuration renders every present preset bit-identically to the full build's goldens; with `--emu` the
emulator boots each image and the audio stays silent (rms 0); every engine built has a loadable entry on the PRESETS list
(a factory preset, else INIT) and every drum source a kit (`tests/preset_cover_test.c`, also run by `tests/builder_test.py` on the profiles,
named edge cases and 12 random choices of the sound sources: each is refused by validate() or holds). Host tests: `tests/run_tests.sh` (includes the
full -> reduced -> full project round trip).

**FM6 cut, 2026-10-18.** FM6 keeps its one synthesis (Dexed's MODERN, bit-exact) and the on-device operator editor. Retired items (their bits are never reused; an old `.config` naming them loads, the builder says "dropped" and ignores them): `FM6_MARK1` (bit 10), `FM6_MODERN` (11), `FM6_OPL` (12), `FM6_MKI_FLASH` (89), `FM6_VOICES` (15), `FM6_STORE` (16), `FM6_ALL` (80), `FM6_ALGO` (81). New: the voice packs `FM6_PK_KEYS` .. `FM6_PK_80S` (bits 93..97). Gone from the sound with them: ENGINE, MOD, M.TIM, C.TIM, the R01..R16 voices, the U01..U32 bank, STORE and SEND, the web editor's FM6 tab, 2.4's FM6 bank import. **Old data**: a project or user preset with an R or U VOICE number plays its own voice when it holds one inline (most do) and shows INIT VOICE; one without starts from INIT VOICE; the packs have their own stored numbers (64 + pack x 16 + place) so no old number lands on a pack voice. An old MOD / M.TIM / C.TIM over an inline voice is baked into it once on load (MOD to the nearest output level step of the modulators, 0.75 dB against 0.375: approximate below level 20; M.TIM / C.TIM into the envelope rates, nearest rate step); with no inline voice they are dropped. An old ENGINE of MARK I (the old default) or OPL now plays MODERN: slightly different tone, not recoverable.
