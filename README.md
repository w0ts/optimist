<p align="center"><b>A live groovebox firmware for the M-VAVE FM-1 — for any style.</b><br>
Free and open source (GPL-3.0), based on <a href="https://github.com/hugelton/Felucca">Felucca</a>.</p>

---

SLOOP turns the FM-1 into a four-track groovebox you play live: three synths and a drum machine with 16 sounds on the white keys, nine synthesis engines, your own samples, a song mode you play with your hands. House, techno, hip-hop, drum & bass, synthwave, lo-fi, ambient, chiptune — it does not pick a style for you. No factory patterns, nothing to load: everything you hear, you play.

## New in 2.2

- **A new drum engine** built like the classic machines (tuned body and pitch drop, click, noise through a resonant filter, drive; softer hits are darker). 32 synthesised kits rebuilt on it — new: PHONK, AMAPIANO, UK GARAGE, deep house — and a sampled **acoustic kit** (CC0 studio recordings). Every kit is level-matched.
- **68 sounds, browsed by kind** (basses, keys, organs, pads, leads, plucks and bells, stabs), all level-matched. 14 new, among them 808 SLIDE, ACID 303, SUPERSAW, M1 PIANO, AFRO KEYS, KALIMBA, DUB CHORD, HOUSE ORGN — and **GRAND PNO**, a real Steinway grand (CC0).
- **Lock a layer:** hold a layer button and tap HOME — it stays open with both hands free (FX on the keys with one hand, FILTER / DUST / DUCK with the other). Any other button lets it go.
- **Stereo chorus and a new stereo reverb** (a feedback delay network: dense, no metallic ring).
- **More reliable:** saves retried until they succeed, the song end gives your loop back, swing never plays a step twice, no click on retriggered voices, the installer refuses a damaged package, no more flicker on the button lights.

Everything in [SLOOP.md](SLOOP.md#new-in-22).

## Features

- **Hold a button, touch a key.** Every function button is a layer: hold it and the 16 white keys and the four knobs change job, and the screen shows how. Tap it and its pages open.
  - **FX**: 16 punch-in effects (loops, stutter, reverse, tape stop, filters, crush…)
  - **EDIT**: erase a sound or a note as the loop plays; shift, double or halve the pattern; undo / redo
  - **ARP**: note repeat (1/8 to 1/64), locked to the grid
  - **SEQ**: step entry, with a level and a ratchet per step
  - **SCL**: the key of the song, and one-key chords (triad, 7th, 9th, sus4, power)
  - **GLO**: mute, solo, FX on / off per track, tap tempo, track levels
  - **SAVE**: play sections A–D live, record the song as you play
  - Keys 1, 5, 9 and 13 glow dimly as landmarks: the rows of the 4 × 4 grid on the screen
  - Hold a layer button and tap HOME to lock the layer open: both hands free
- **Drums:** 16 sounds on the white keys, ghost and hard hits (hold OCT− / OCT+), ratchets x1–x4, 37 kits (a sampled acoustic kit in 5 treatments, 32 synthesised: 808, 909, 606, house, deep house, techno, minimal, electro, trap, drill, phonk, UK garage, jungle, dubstep, reggaeton, amapiano, afrobeat, latin, disco, synthwave, chiptune, industrial, hyperpop, ambient, jazz brushes…), all level-matched.
- **Synths:** 10 engines — analog, polyphonic supersaw, 4-op FM, phase distortion, three-oscillator, tonewheel organ, formant voice, granular, lo-fi chip, sampler — with envelopes, LFO, arpeggiator, glide, drive, slicer and sends to a stereo chorus, a tempo delay and a stereo reverb. 73 presets to start from, browsed by kind and level-matched (sliding 808s, acid, reese and FM basses, a Steinway grand, Rhodes, house and afro keys, organs, supersaw, plucks and bells, stabs and dub chords, pads, talkbox, scratches) and 32 slots for your own.
- **Recording with no click:** a free take sets the loop length and the tempo from your playing; REC records at once while playing; notes land where you heard them (latency-compensated).
- **Groove:** MPC-style swing (50–75 %), a sample-accurate clock (no drift at any tempo), polymeters.
- **Master:** DUST (old sampler + vinyl), DUCK (the kick pumps the synths), a DJ filter.
- **Memory:** undo / redo, autosave of the working project, 4 projects, 32 user presets.
- **Songs, live:** hold SAVE and press a key — sections A–D start on the next bar, always in time; SONG REC writes the order you play into the song, PLAY in song mode plays it back.
- **Your own samples:** three user slots; the web editor chops a recording into 16 pieces (tap along while it plays) and uploads them.
- **Web editor:** every parameter, the drum track as a 16-lane grid, the mixer, a preset library, sample upload. Live sync with the device.

## Install

**From the browser:** open **[the SLOOP installer](https://isod89.github.io/sloop-fm1/)** in **Chrome or Edge**, connect the FM-1 by USB (a data cable, no hub), press **INSTALL** and wait for *Done*. Nothing to download or compile. The [web editor](https://isod89.github.io/sloop-fm1/webapp/editor/) works the same way.

Other ways: the `.fwsc` of each [release](../../releases) with `python tools/fm1_install.py sloop-2.2.fwsc` (needs `pip install mido python-rtmidi`), or build it yourself and run `INSTALL-SLOOP.bat` (Windows).

Going back: M-VAVE's own updater (M-UPGRADE) and the official FM-1 firmware. If an install is cut off, the FM-1 stays in update mode: press Install again and it finishes.

> Custom firmware is installed at your own risk. If an FM-1 no longer starts, recovery needs [FM-1-transporter](https://github.com/kurogedelic/FM-1-transporter).

## Building

See [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md). In short: the JieLi toolchain and three files of the AC79 SDK, then `./build.sh` (Linux / macOS) or `INSTALL-SLOOP.bat` (Windows with WSL). `tests/run_tests.sh` runs the host test suite (audio renders, sequencer timing, UI, storage, update loader, web pages).
