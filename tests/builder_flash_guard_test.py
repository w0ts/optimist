"""The builder menu's flash guard (tools/builder/stamp.py) and the package source the flash confirmation shows
(tools/flash.py package_source / source_notes). No device, no build: temporary packages and a temporary git repo.

2026-10-12: a builder menu left open 21 hours flashed build/optimist-0.1-dev-1830f0b.fwsc, a 4-hour-old build of
another commit and of the profile as it was then, as "the last build"; the FM-1 went to its USB rescue. These checks
pin what f may flash now. Then, when Textual is there (this Python or the builder venv's), the menu itself is driven
headless (Builder.run_test): f with no build, after a configuration change, and after a build all refuse or go as
stamp.refusal says, and nothing reaches the device (flash.preflight replaced)."""
