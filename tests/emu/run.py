"""The emulator smoke checks (make emu-check; BUILDING.md, "The emulator checks"). Opt-in: they need Rust (cargo) and the emulator
(tests/emu/session.py says which); not part of make test or make gate.

  python3 tests/emu/run.py [FIRMWARE.fwsc] [--only CHECK[,CHECK..]] [--mhz N] [--out DIR] [--jobs N] [--list]

FIRMWARE: a package with its ELF beside it (default build/felucca.fwsc, the last build). The checks that drove SLOOP's
UI's panel (patterns, fx, insfx, persist, scenefx) went with it (2026-10-19). Each check prints PASS / FAIL lines and works in OUT/<check>/ (default build/emu-check/: its package copy,
flash state, WAVs and screens). Exit 1 on any FAIL (a check that stops on an error counts as one).

A DUAL build whose second core starts (FELUCCA_DUAL, not parked) is refused (exit 2): the emulator's timing model does
not represent the chip's dual-core timing (2026-10-16: a DUAL build with stock's flash park showed one late half at 96 MHz
in the boot's burst of flash writes, none at 192 MHz, none on the FM-1), so the gate runs a DUAL profile single core:
its build with OPTIMIST_DUAL_PARK=1 (CPU1 never started). The second core itself is verified by the host tests (the
supply sequence, the order, the read-back, the fallback), the BLE emulator tests (tests/dual_stockorder_emu_test.py,
tests/dual_ble_rule_emu_test.py), tests/emu_boot_check.py and the hardware matrix / soak (docs/DUAL-CORE.md sections 3 and 5).
EMU_DUAL=1 runs the checks on it anyway (for a look, not a gate).

--jobs N: the checks run N at a time, each in a process of its own (its emulator, its OUT/<check>/ with its flash
state and scratch files), its lines buffered and printed whole in the list's order (default: every check at once,
--jobs 1: one after the other in this process). `timing` (late halves at 48 / 96 / 192 MHz) runs alone, after the
others."""
