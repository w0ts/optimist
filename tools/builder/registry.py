"""The firmware builder's registry: every item a build may leave out, its switch, its options, where it came from.

One source of truth for tools/builder/configure.py (the .config -> build/gen/felucca_config.h), the budget
(costs.json, measured by tools/builder/measure_costs.py) and the menu (tools/menuconfig). The firmware side of
each switch is in firmware/src/core/registry.h (engines, kits, FX, FM6 options, features) or in the existing flags.

Rules (docs/BUILDER.md):
  - one level: a top-level item and its own options; an option never depends on another option or on another
    top-level item; options are ignored while their parent is off;
  - "bit" numbers are stable (the BUILD SysEx reports them): append only, never reuse;
  - items backported from another project carry provenance (project, author, licence, commit, url); an item
    from X0X (charlesvestal/fm1-x0x, GPL-3.0-only) shows its notice in the menu when selected. Anything X0X
    uses only by its author's permission (its break player, dsp/breaks*: no licence) is never offered.
