"""Measure every registry item: one measurement build per non-default value (tools/build.py --measure links past
the slot, so the full configuration measures too). Writes tools/builder/costs.json: the default build's sizes
and, per item and value, the bytes it adds to it (flash, RAM, pool, RAMTEXT); its "cpu" section (the emulator's
scale, docs/CPU-GUARD.md) stays, and the CPU guard's model is generated again (cpu_costs.py). Options are measured with their
parent on; PAIRS (an item whose cost depends on another's value) are measured together as well, and the check
configurations (every profile, tools/builder/estimate/*.config) once each, for tests/builder_test.py to hold the
estimate against (docs/BUILDER.md, Budget); the menu's Build gives exact numbers.

  python3 tools/builder/measure_costs.py [--only KEY ...] [--missing [--check]] [--log DIR] [--jobs N]
--missing measures only what costs.json lacks (new items, new pairs; the base again whenever it moved at all) and keeps the rest; --missing --check builds nothing and fails when something is lacking
(CI). The builds are planned first (a pass that builds nothing), made --jobs at a time, each in its own build
directory (build/slots/N; default: sized to the CPUs and the RAM, default_jobs), with a progress line per build (done /
all, the time so far and the time left), then read back by the same pass. About 20 s a build under Docker on an arm64
Mac (the one-file firmware: no build reuses another's objects); --jobs 1 builds one at a time in build/ as before.
Not detected: an item whose code changed after it was measured (no item-to-source map): re-measure it with --only."""
