"""The CPU guard's cost model (CPU_GUARD, firmware/src/system/cpuguard.c), generated from measured data, never hand-tuned.

Inputs:
  tests/cpu_baseline.txt   the host CPU baseline tests/regress.c writes (BUDGET_UPDATE=1): instructions per sample
                           of each engine x preset with 8 notes held (VOICE 4, ACID 1, JUNO 6: its voices), of the idle mix
                           and of the idle mix with the drum groove
  tools/builder/costs.json "cpu": the target's instructions per host instruction, per engine where measured
                           ("scale_pct", "engine_pct"), fitted in the emulator (docs/CPU-GUARD.md, "Calibration")
Output: firmware/src/system/cpuguard_costs.h (target instructions a sample):
  CG_COST_BASE    the idle mix (buses, master, the parts' fixed work, the sequencer)
  CG_COST_DRUMS   the drum groove on top of it (any drum voice sounding)
  CG_VCOST[uid]   one sounding voice of each engine (by engine UID, registry.h ENGINE_LIST): the median over the
                  engine's presets of (preset - idle) / voices; an engine with no baseline entry (not built when
                  the baseline was taken) gets the largest measured one (an estimate errs high there)
  CG_X0X[ch]      one sounding X0X channel (drum_x0x.c: 0..10 the 909's voices, 11..23 the 808's lanes; cpu/x0x/chNN,
                  the channel kept sounding) less what the channels of its machine share: (the sum of its channels -
                  all of them at once, cpu/x0x/909_all / 808_all) / (channels - 1)
  CG_X0X_SHARED   counted once while any X0X channel sounds: the smaller of the two machines' shared work (most of it
                  is common to both: the summed channels' one pass of the mix, drum_x0x.c drums_x0x)
  CG_COST_TCOMP   a part's COMP insert while it runs (fx.c tcomp_run): cpu/fx/comp_on (the insert at 127 on a part
                  of 8 voices) less cpu/fx/comp_off (the same part, COMP in a slot at 0); 0 when not measured
  CG_COST_DBDIST  the drum bus's DIST while it runs (fx.c dbus_dist_run): cpu/fx/dbus_dist (the drum groove, the
                  drum track's DST 127) less cpu/fx/dbus_off (the groove, every drum bus amount 0); 0 when not measured
  CG_COST_DBCOMP  the drum bus's COMP while it runs (fx.c dbus_comp_run): cpu/fx/dbus_comp (COMP in S1, 127) less
                  cpu/fx/dbus_off
  CG_COST_DVDIST  a drum voice's DIST while it runs (fx.c dins_post), counted per voice: cpu/fx/dvoice_dist (one snare a
                  beat, every sound's DST 127) less cpu/fx/dvoice_off (the same, 0)
  CG_COST_DVCOMP  a drum voice's COMP while it runs, per voice: cpu/fx/dvoice_comp (COMP in S1, every sound's 127) less
                  cpu/fx/dvoice_off
  CG_COST_PDIST   a part's DIST insert while it runs (the track insert slots, fx.c ins_part): cpu/fx/part_dist (DIGITAL,
                  8 voices, S1 DIST 127) less cpu/fx/part_off (the same, both slots at 0)
  CG_COST_PFILT   a part's FILTER insert while it runs (fx.c tflt_part): cpu/fx/part_filt (S2 FILTER low-pass) less
                  cpu/fx/part_off
  CG_COST_DBFILT  the drum bus's FILTER while it runs (fx.c dbus_ins): cpu/fx/dbus_filt (the groove, the drum track's
                  FILTER low-pass) less cpu/fx/dbus_off. cpu/fx/ins_worst (three full parts with DIST + COMP, the drum
                  bus DIST + FILTER, the groove) is the check of the sum (docs/CPU-GUARD.md)
  CG_COST_PINS[i], CG_COST_DBINS[i]  the further inserts FOLD FUZZ PHSR FLNG FRMT WIDE CHRS ECHO GATER (fx/insfx/insfx.c) while they
                  run, a part's: cpu/fx/part_<t> (S1 at 127) less cpu/fx/part_off; the drum bus's (on its L and R):
                  cpu/fx/dbus_<t> less cpu/fx/dbus_off; 0 when not measured

  CG_COST_PDUST, CG_COST_DBDUST, CG_COST_TLIM, CG_COST_DVINS[i]  (fx-rework, 2026-10-14) DUST on a part (cpu/fx/part_dust less
                  part_off) and on the drum bus (dbus_dust less dbus_off); a part's DYN CEIL (part_lim, CEIL -1 dB, less
                  comp_on); a drum voice's slot of FILT DUST FOLD FUZZ PHSR FRMT (cpu/fx/dvoice_<t> less dvoice_off)
