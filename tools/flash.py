"""Flash a build to an FM-1 over USB-MIDI: the step behind `python tools/optimist.py flash` and the builder menu's
"Flash to FM-1". It checks, shows and asks; the write itself is tools/fm1_install.py, the same update the web
installer does (it needs mido and python-rtmidi: `python tools/optimist.py setup` puts them in the builder venv).

  preflight(package)  -> a Plan: the package's identity, the running FM-1's (fm1_install.py --info), what will happen
  install(plan)       -> fm1_install.py PACKAGE --yes (never --force: only a package with the Felucca loader)

Never picks a stock or foreign package: the default is the newest build/optimist-*.fwsc, and a package must be an
Optimist one (identity FM-1_700, or FM-1_720 .. 769 for a release) that fm1_install.load_package accepts.
Nothing here touches MIDI itself: every device access goes through run_tool() (fm1_install.py in a subprocess),
which the tests replace."""
